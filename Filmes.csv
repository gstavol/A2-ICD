Directed by Kelsey Mann, the film revisits Riley as she navigates the complexities of teenage life, with her emotions—Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust—returning to guide her. The movie introduces new emotions, adding fresh dynamics and challenges. The animation is vibrant and expressive, capturing the nuanced portrayal of inner emotional worlds. With its clever storytelling, humor, and poignant moments, ""Inside Out 2"" resonates deeply with audiences, offering a thoughtful exploration of growing up and emotional resilience.'], ['-', 'The wizards at Pixar have crafted a new gem with “Inside Out 2” which is a rare achievement in that it is a sequel that outdoes the original film.\nThe movie opens with Riley (Kensington Tallman), just after her 13th Birthday as Joy (Amy Poehler) recaps her accomplishments and sets the stage for her big Hockey Game with her friends Grace (Grace Lu) and Bree (Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green).\nTheir success on the ice attracts the attention of the coach of the local Firebirds who invites the trio to a three-day camp which will set the stage for them to be included on the team as freshmen.\nThings take a turn when a Puberty alarm goes off followed by a construction crew to upgrade the console. Fear (Tony Hale), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Liza Lapira), and Sadness (Phyllis Smith),  do not react well to this and the arrival of the new emotions Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui  (Adèle Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter-Hauser), sets the stage for new conflicts.\nRiley arrives at camp and becomes enchanted with the popular girls who are fronted by Valentina (Lilimar), and Riley excludes her friends as a chance to be part of the in-crowd.\nThe new emotions set a course to keep Riley safe from her potential future issues and banish the old emotions that they view as hindering Riley and setting a path for future failure.\nForced to travel to the furthest reaches of Riley’s mind to recover something of necessity; the old emotions hope to undo the damage being done and restore Riley who is in the turmoil of being a teen and hampered by the flood of new and often conflicting emotions and circumstances that she encounters.\nThe movie is filled with charm and humor as well as presenting an honest look at the changes and pressures that children face during their teen years and does so without being heavy-handed. The emotions new and old are great and there are many moments throughout the film that will bring laughter as well as nostalgia for adults; especially those with children who are about to enter their Teen years.\nThe film is moving and there were more than a few eyes welling up near the end of the film during our screening as Pixar has once again crafted an enjoyable and relatable tale that can be enjoyed by the entire family.\n4.5 stars out of 5.'], ['60%', 'I really quite enjoyed the first of these (2015) but I struggled a bit to stay engaged with the one. ""Riley"" is still happily coasting through family life until one day, she embarks on the yellow brick road that is puberty. Towit, her control gallery is no longer the purview of just her lifelong guides like ""Fear"", ""Joy"" and ""Anger"" - now she has also to deal with the likes of disgust, envy, boredom and worst of all - anxiety. It\'s maybe the latter that the film should be called as we now embark on quite a humourless swipe at the culture of validation that young people must navigate. It\'s all about being popular. Being liked. Being the best - in the ice hockey team. Old loyalties go under the bus in favour of new aspirations and yes, much of it does ring quite true as an evaluation of the fickleness in all of us. Thing is, though, there\'s just too much inevitability about what comes next and there\'s way too much incessant dialogue. ""Anger"" has some fun along the way, and there is the odd comedy one-liner from the laconic ""Ennui"" but it just didn\'t resonate with me at all. The animation is standard Pixar fayre that does the job colourfully but unremarkably, and by the conclusion I was hoping there was an off button on that great big console. Yep - I\'m probably too old to really appreciate this the way the kids can, but the trick for these studios has to be to engage the adults at the same time as the weans, else out come the mobile phones as our own version of ennui sets in.

They just haven't been able to catch a break this decade! Having a majority of their originals dumbed on Disney+, Lightyear flopping, and Elemental just barely managing to make a comeback after having the studio's worst opening yet. They just can't catch a break, specially with Disney laying off their animators and refusing to let them make any originals anymore. Safe to say, they've had it rough! But Inside Out 2, despite many things working against it actually managed to be good, in fact great! Almost as good as its predecessor. I'm not gonna fully say it's a masterpiece like any of their older films, or even films like Soul or the first Inside Out, but it's still a pretty great movie! A movie that honors the original while adding to the original's themes. Instead of just being the first movie again, they actually do things a little different, by adding new emotions, covering the themes of puberty and anxiety, and adding some new locations. I also like how they don't just reset Joy back to the way she was in movie 1, they actually stick to her character development, letting the others help her, especially Sadness, and being open to new ideas. She's still flawed, of course, but it's more still growing as a character rather than just learning the same lesson again. They even subvert the originals message. Inside Out 1: it's okay to not be happy. Inside Out 2: It's okay to let happiness in. You are valued and you are good enough. There's also one scene in the movie : the panic attack. I won't spoil what happens but I really love how this scene played out. Altogether, a pretty solid film that builds on the original ti the point where I'd actually say I'd be open for a 3rd movie, something I thought I'd never, ever say ever!!! Congrats, Pix!

It takes far too long to get going, this, but once we\'ve established who is who and the story has kicked in, it\'s quite an exciting tale with some great visuals effects and just a little philosophy to keep it from falling into a trap of franchise mundanity. The acting isn\'t really up to much, but an enthusiastic effort from Kevin Durand as the menacing leader and some authentic looking acrobatics not seen since Johnny Weissmuller make for an entertaining episode in what is clearly a soap-style plot development where this is but an episode in a what happens next scenario.'], ['60%', ""Has its moments, though overall I kinda found 'Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes' a bit of a slog to sit through.\nThe original trilogy are films that I do enjoy, they're very good.

The exploration of the mythology which has built up with regards to their past and Caesar's time is also interesting.\nProximus isn't even really a villain as such, which makes him and his vision for the future a nice counter to the uncertain goals of Noa's human companion.\nParticularly enjoyed the ending, which, when you realise it is coming, you have to laugh as it has been set up throughout the movie.\nAnd the little kicker was good too.

It\'s almost as if there is an ""X-Factor"" judging panel inside everyone\'s head making decisions and discussing with each other which of their traits ought to prevail as circumstances dictate - and in the main it works well. It ultimately serves to advise that none of these emotions can exist in isolation and that we must learn to take the rough with the smooth, the good with the not so good.

The President (Nick Offerman) makes a speech assuring the rest of his country that they\'ve nothing to worry about, but hardened photo-journalist ""Lee"" (Kirsten Dunst) and her cohort ""Joel"" (Wagner Moura) reckon that the conflict is quite likely to come to an altogether different conclusion.

Did the President seize power? Was he elected from a party these states didn\'t vote for? Are they just brutal and well armed revolutionaries?

The filmmaker’s gripping tale of a quartet of journalists (Kirsten Dunst, Wagner Moura, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Cailee Spaeny) covering a civil war in a dystopian version of America of the near future follows the reporters as they make their way from New York to Washington via a circuitous route that shows them all sides of this nightmarish scenario. Essentially a road trip film, “Civil War” provides the principals and viewers with an array of images and situations graphically depicting what’s left of the US as a distraught population attempts to make sense of the circumstances and find ways to survive. The purpose of the protagonists’ journey is to secure an interview (likely the last one) with a corrupt, egomaniacal President (Nick Offerman) as rebel forces close in on the capital. They set out on this treacherous odyssey despite the dangers involved both in making the trip and in their roles as journalists, who are looked on with suspicion and have been accused of fanning the flames of the hostilities. While some have complained that the film doesn’t provide enough social and political background about the conflict, I submit that this consideration is fundamentally unnecessary: Garland is making an unadulterated statement here that, when the bullets start flying, ideology won’t matter and no one will care, a point driven home with chilling clarity over and over. The madness that consumes the population is all that’s important at that juncture, one driven by bald-faced hostility on steroids both among the combatants and the overzealousness of the reporters in seeking to “get the story,” no matter what. In achieving this end, the filmmaker holds nothing back, making this an often-difficult watch, one definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart. But the picture’s message is one of grave importance, especially in today’s trying, polarized climate. We’d be wise to pay attention to what’s being said in this important work, handily the best – and most troubling – release of 2024 thus far.'], ['70%', ""The film, although set in a context of armed conflict, deviates from the traditional war theme to focus on war photojournalists, promoting a perspective on the work of such professionals. Through a series of small scenes, the director seeks to compose a portrait of these professionals' actions on the battlefield without declaring the reasons for the war or identifying the sides involved.\nEach scene, individually, is well-executed, standing out for the quality of cinematography and an immersive sound work that amplifies the tension. However, these scenes, although effective individually, fail to come together cohesively. The result is a film that seems less than the sum of its parts. The main problem with the film is a lack of depth.\nAlthough technically well-produced, particularly in terms of audio, the film falls short of a deeper approach, which could have elevated it from a mere display of impactful scenes to a truly impactful work.""], ['60%', 'In spite of its pretensions, Civil War is essentially a derivative affair filled with  calculatedly disturbing visuals and violent exposition.\nCharacter development and a functioning back story are largely absent, from Civil War. This is an exposition driven road trip from hell, with a nihilistic objective, that plays out to a predictable conclusion.\nThat does not really leave a lot, for the viewer, to take away from this film. A film which should have a lot to say but is, instead, conspicuously silent. Perhaps this is a reaction to the climate of division and fear that exists in the USA today? That said, why make a film about something contentious, if you have nothing contentious to say?\nIn summary, this film really needed to be more opinionated, even if that means offering up opposing perspectives.

Firstly, I\'m not too fond of Michael Bay as a director (as a producer, he\'s fine). The way he directs his action sequences is incredibly choppy, filled with questionable CGI, very hard to follow, and we all know his passion for exploding everything. Oh, and I can\'t forget about the constant product placement (amazing how in a brutal explosion, everything is destroyed except a gorgeous-looking Audi car that remains intact). Secondly, the storytelling always felt extremely generic and unsurprising. So, obviously, my expectations weren\'t very high…\nMaybe that\'s why I enjoyed Bad Boys For Life way more than I anticipated. This movie should be a lesson to the Fast and Furious franchise. To make a mindless entertaining action flick, the lighthearted tone has to be well-established from the get-go. Despite the fact that the third act deals with absurd emotional twists worthy of a Mexican soap opera, the screenwriters are able to find just the right amount of harmless fun. I didn\'t watch a single clip before the film, and ten minutes in, I acknowledged that its goal was to simply be entertaining without taking itself too seriously.\nAdil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah balance the more dramatic family issues with the ludicrous action very well. The latter sequences are much better than Bay\'s. The car chases, even when containing a few too many cuts, are relatively easy to follow, and they pack that necessary adrenaline rush. There are a few surprising shootouts that are filmed to make them look like one take, which definitely brings something pretty uncommon to this kind of formulaic action movies. Technically, I think both directors did an excellent job, especially considering that this was their debut feature film.\nHowever, the story brings everything down. I believe Mexican soap operas might have better scripts. The dialogue reaches such a cringe-worthy level. Every essential plot information is given either through lazy character interactions or by that magical computer that every generic action movie possesses with which the main characters can basically know everything about everyone at the click of a few buttons. The comedy is quite hit-and-miss to me, a lot of the jokes didn\'t land, but some did make me chuckle. Overall, the screenplay is as cliche as it could be, and that last shot… I hate it. In the end, it\'s the cast who saves the boring narrative.\nWill Smith and Martin Lawrence share fantastic chemistry, and their banter is always entertaining to watch, even if it isn\'t as hilarious as it could be. I liked Lawrence more than Smith, maybe due to the non-action, family comedy bits that worked seamlessly. Nevertheless, it\'s dumb fun, and it\'s plainly visible that the actors had a blast shooting this movie. The whole cast transfer the joy that they had on set to the screen, and it\'s pretty noticeable. Watching Alexander Ludwig (Dorn) outside Vikings is always a pleasure (I so wish that he gets more important roles in the future), and the whole AMMO team (Vannesa Hudgens, Charles Melton, Paola Nunez) is all compelling enough, even if the characters are two-dimensional.\nIt\'s simple: whether you enjoy the Bad Boys saga or not, this is undoubtedly the best installment of the franchise. If you go to the film theater with basic expectations of having fun, Bad Boys For Life gives you that, so I recommend it. It\'s a pure popcorn-entertainment action flick with recognizable actors who all share great chemistry. With Michael Bay out of the director helm, Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah deliver surprisingly good action sequences, considering this is their debut feature film. The formulaic, cliche, soap opera story is straight-up ridiculous at some points, and it carries such an aura of predictability that when it tries to introduce an emotional twist, it merely becomes absurd. The last shot feels like a call to Hollywood to make more sequels, which sort of ruins the whole ""Bad Boys one last time"" tagline… I\'m extremely undecided on which side this review should fall, so I\'ll base my decision on the answer to the following question: ""Am I going to (want to) see this movie again or another sequel?"" Honestly… no.\nRating: C+'], ['40%', ""The list of what's wrong with 'Bad Boys For Life' is long and varied, but it's not all bad.

In any event, I relented in this case, because I was admittedly curious to see the film’s Oscar-winning visual effects, which, in all honesty, weren’t bad (though definitely not outstanding – how this picture bested the far-superior visuals of “The Creator” truly baffles me). However, capable special effects and production design considerations aside (the basis for the generous ratings I’ve given to this title), this release has little else to offer that hasn’t already been depicted countless times before. What’s more, the film’s attempts at trying to incorporate post-World War II political commentary and to be more than just a simplistic monster movie are fairly lame. Its non-devastation story threads are frequently predictable, heavy-handed, slowly paced, occasionally corny, often implausible, and, above all, boring. I frankly couldn’t wait for these segments to end and get back to the supposed “it” factor – the monster’s destructive hijinks (of which, to be perfectly honest, there were too few, given that this is supposed to be this offering’s primary drawing card). Even the title of this production needs work; any picture that requires a Google search to find out what it’s supposed to mean has inherent issues in my book. To its credit, writer-director Takashi Yamazaki’s effort to elevate the Godzilla narrative above the B movie camp fest level genuinely seems sincere, but the end product is little more than the standard item with better visuals and a well-intentioned (but largely failed) aim at infusing the story with more substantive content. In light of the many iterations of this saga that have been filmed over the years, I think it’s high time to give the persecuted sea monster a well-deserved rest for a while – a long while – and get on with the business of making movies that aren’t tiresome retreads and that at last give Tokyo a chance to rebuild.'], ['70%', 'Contain Spoilers\n""Gojira -1.0"" is a visually stunning film that rightfully earned its Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. The movie\'s impressive sound design and solid acting further elevate its entertainment value. However, it falls short in some key areas, particularly in its direction and emotional payoff.\nThe visual effects in ""Gojira -1.0"" are nothing short of spectacular. From the realistic physics to the terrifyingly detailed explosions caused by Gojira\'s atomic breath, every frame is crafted with precision. The depiction of Gojira itself is a highlight, staying true to the original bulky yet menacing design without appearing comical. This attention to detail creates a believable and immersive experience that keeps you engaged throughout.\nThe sound design and music, while not as groundbreaking as the visual effects, complement the movie well. They enhance the tension and atmosphere, making the scenes more impactful. The acting is another strong point, with Japanese actors delivering powerful and emotional performances that resonate deeply. Their portrayal of honor and shame, especially in the context of post-WWII Japan, adds a layer of depth to the story.\nThe writing of ""Gojira -1.0"" is intriguing, presenting a fresh take on the origins of Gojira with a strong emphasis on the historical context of Japan after World War II. The decision to show events through the eyes of a \'failed\' kamikaze soldier is an interesting angle, though it doesn\'t fully deliver on its potential. The survival of the main character, while logically sound, feels anticlimactic and predictable. This resolution undercuts the emotional investment built up throughout the film, leaving a sense of dissatisfaction.\nOne aspect that could have been better addressed is the radiation from Gojira. The monster emits radiation and can fire atomic blasts, yet the film doesn\'t explore the devastating effects this should have on the surrounding environment and people. The radiation is merely used as a plot device to track Gojira, missing an opportunity to add another layer of realism and tension to the story.\nIn conclusion, ""Gojira -1.0"" is a visually and technically impressive film that provides solid entertainment and remarkable detail. However, it falls short in delivering a satisfying emotional payoff and leaves some aspects underexplored. Despite these shortcomings, it remains a worthwhile watch for its exceptional visual effects and the nostalgic yet fresh portrayal of Gojira.']]"

Writer-director Jane Schoenbrun’s incomprehensible smart horror offering is an absolute utter waste of time, not to mention the ticket price. This glacially paced story of two psychologically and emotionally troubled teens, Owen (Ian Forema) and Maddy (Brigitte Lundy-Paine), who bond over a cheesy late night 1990s young adult sci-fi/horror television series called The Pink Opaque struggles mightily to find its way. As Owen grows into an adult (Justice Smith), his cohort vanishes mysteriously when the TV series is abruptly cancelled, leaving him wondering what happened to her until she just as mysteriously reappears years later with a disjointed story that makes no sense from top to bottom. As the film’s narrator, Owen tries earnestly to explain, but his recounting of this experience is equally baffling, especially when he tells why Maddy has come back after her protracted absence. The result is an unintelligible tale that’s far from frightening (even metaphorically speaking) and ends up being a convoluted mix of 1990s teen angst, extended and inexplicably incorporated music videos, an exploration of sexual ambiguity, and a woefully wayward attempt at symbolically addressing issues related to personal disassociation and self-actualization. There are also numerous story elements and images that are included in the narrative that go undeveloped and unexplored.

You'll hate yourself for watching it.""], ['50%', 'Writing a review for a sequel like “Fast X” feels pretty pointless. It’s the type of adrenaline-fueled blockbuster that rabid fans will eagerly shell out money to see and want to love, while snobby critics will begrudgingly watch with a chip on their shoulder combined with a predetermined disdain for whatever will unfold. I’m a big fan of the series, even when it veered away from fast cars and leaned into the street superhero action angle. Most moviegoers would expect “Fast X” to be a film that’s packed with big, loud, dumb fun. It’s big and loud (and certainly dumb), but there admittedly is a slight shortage of fun.\nThe plot is so stupid, but it builds on the best film of the franchise, “Fast Five.” If you don’t remember the movie, don’t worry: the first 15 minutes are a rehash of everything that happened. Even newbies will be up to speed quickly. The film focuses on Dante (Jason Momoa), a formidable foe who is fueled by revenge. He’s ready for blood, and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his “family” are squarely in his sights. This installment takes the crew from Rome to Rio de Janeiro and beyond, with explosions, car chases, fist fights, and lots of faces from the past.\nThe story isn’t what most came for anyway, and the pacing slows under the weight of Diesel growling about “family” and “faith.” The jokes aren’t really funny either, and Louis Leterrier‘s direction is lacking. The threadbare writing is awful. The CGI looks shoddy. The situations our heroes are put in are so far-fetched and ridiculous that it makes Tej (Ludacris) and Roman’s (Tyrese Gibson) trip into space in “F9” seem like no big deal. In other words, there is a lot to dislike about this movie — but there’s also plenty to enjoy.\nThe stunt driving is absolutely spectacular, as are the majority of the action sequences. For every misstep, there’s an equally thrilling chase (like a bomb tearing through the streets of Rome). The cast mostly gives performances that are better than expected. The real MVP here is Momoa, who creates a truly terrifying character in Dante, a big screen villain for the ages. Obviously having fun with the role, Momoa completely steals and runs away with the movie.

Nolan’s three-hour opus about the life of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), director of the Manhattan Project (and more commonly known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb), provides viewers with a comprehensive biography of this brilliant and thoughtful yet often-inscrutable and naïve physicist who took on a patently dangerous venture that left him morally conflicted about the nature of his creation. The story, which spans several decades of the scientist’s life, chronicles his development of “the gadget” and the fallout he suffered as a consequence of his left-wing political leanings and his efforts to keep the released nuclear genie from getting out of control. The film is admittedly a little overlong and probably could have used some editing in the opening and final hour, but, in the interest of telling the whole story of Oppenheimer’s odyssey, its length is understandable (and, consequently, justifiable). The picture’s production values are all top shelf, especially its brilliant cinematography, stirring original score and superb sound quality, an element that truly leaves audiences with a bona fide visceral experience. Moreover, the narrative is skillfully and eloquently brought to life by this offering’s outstanding ensemble cast, including Murphy, Matt Damon, Tom Conti, Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, and, especially, Robert Downey Jr., who delivers a stellar, award-worthy supporting performance showing acting chops that I never knew he possessed. “Oppenheimer” is easily the best film of the summer movie season, if not all of 2023 thus far. It packs a potent punch and delivers a message that we can all never hear too often, poignantly reminding us all of the importance of not falling prey to the same Promethean burden that Oppenheimer was forced to shoulder.'], ['70%', 'Cillian Murphy offers an assured and considered performance here as the man who is credited with developing the bomb that hastened the end of WWII in the far east. He is the increasingly acclaimed, eponymous, physicist who is made aware by Admiral Lewis Strauss (another strong performance from Robert Downey Jr.) that it just possible that the Russians have the A-bomb. Now Oppenheimer already suspects that the Nazis are also well on their way to weaponising the atom - his earlier education and career had introduced him to some of the prominent minds in the UK and in Germany who were quite capable of taking the theory forward; so he begins to pressurise the American government to begin it\'s own programme - and the ""Manhattan Project"" is born. Motivated/goaded/galvanised by the ambitious ""Col. Groves"" (Matt Damon) he assembles a formidable collection of scientific minds at a purpose built, desert, location which he christens Los Alamos, and over the next three years - and with $2bn to spend - they work on the science whilst plutonium and uranium are being simultaneously processed at an irkingly glacial pace! Given that much of this is reasonably well documented history, the actual plot here has little by way of jeopardy. Instead, Christopher Nolan attempts via his writing and direction to put some meat on the bones of the characters here. It\'s clear that Oppenheimer is a bit of a Lothario, but it\'s also clear that he can engender the loyalty of a variety of people with diverging views - not just surrounding the science of their project, but around the morals and ethics of creating something that - well, you can\'t get the toothpaste back into the tube. The latter portion of this drama focusses on the subsequent, communist-obsessed, witch-hunting that went on attempting to persecute and smear this remarkable and flawed individual, and it makes some interesting postulations about just who was pulling whose strings. It also has quite a penetrating resonation about it - not just, specifically, about Oppeneheimer - but about all of those post-event ""enquiries"" that rarely deliver an honest appraisal of what was done in the name of expediency at the time, but ends up more of a character assassination exercise by those who didn\'t do anything against those who did and had to. Though at times the pace of this thing helps to keep it enthralling, it is too long - at times it really does plod along. Perhaps an other, objective, eye on the writing/direction may have tightened it up without having to sacrifice any of the potency of the story. Maybe someone needs to tell Mr. Nolan that a three hour film isn\'t always required! That said, it\'s a gorgeous film to look at. The aesthetics are first rate and the entire sentiment of the film reeks of authenticity. I do think this thrives better on a big screen so try to see it as it was intended. It\'s though provoking, complex, characterful - and well worth a watch.'], ['-', ""This film takes you on an exhilarating journey through history, skillfully weaving together captivating storytelling and breathtaking visuals. The performances were top-notch, leaving me completely immersed in the characters' emotions. A definite must-see!""], ['80%', 'Cillian Murphy, so hot right now. Film is a little long though.'], ['80%', 'The intersection of innovation, science, political bureaucracy, and ethics meet in writer-director Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer,” a dark, challenging biopic about the father of the atomic bomb, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer. This profound epic clocks in at three hours yet never feels too long, even if it’s painfully clear that Nolan is indulging himself in a passion project.\nDuring World War II, Lt. General Leslie Groves Jr. (Matt Damon) appoints physicist Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Assembling a team of the brightest scientists the country has to offer, the experts spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. When their final product is used against Japan on July 16, 1945, the world witnesses its first nuclear explosion in an event that not only ends the war, but forever changes the course of history.\nThere has been much hype about the fact that Nolan chose to film in IMAX, but the large format feels wasted here. The visuals are far from stunning, and the film is mostly a dramatic, dialogue-heavy history lesson that’s a far cry from what I’d call “entertaining.” It’s a great movie that’s engaging, sophisticated, and intelligent, but those expecting traditional thrills are going to be greatly disappointed. Save your money, because seeing this in IMAX isn’t really worth it.\nNolan’s film is poignant in a way that’s chillingly relevant. His story not only explores one of the most important figures in U.S. history, but also makes you think about the current lack of empathy that’s plaguing society. There’s a very real moral question about humanity’s ability to make something that will help save the lives of many but also result in the death of innocents, and Nolan makes a strong political statement in a surprisingly restrained manner. His commentary on the far-reaching effects of such a powerful weapon born from the intersection of innovation, science, and government, while being an invention that has changed but also endangered the world, will give you chills. Nolan’s script is terrific, and is one of my favorite screenplays of the year.\nNolan tells much more of the obscure back story of Oppenheimer’s professional and personal life that few know, and it makes for a lengthy (but interesting) narrative. The film includes his ties to the Communist Party, Hoover’s FBI investigation, his tangles with Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), and an eventual closed-door hearing that was designed to strip him of his security clearance years after the war ended.\n“Oppenheimer” is a complex film that requires your full attention, with myriad characters and time jumps that will keep you on your toes. A basic knowledge of history is beneficial, but those who have only heard the name Robert Oppenheimer and are aware of the very basics (like the fact that he was involved in the creation of the atomic bomb) won’t be completely lost.\nIn addition to complicated discussions of quantum physics, there are weighty themes about the dangers of government bureaucracy and the moral and ethical implications of creating a weapon of mass destruction. Nolan isn’t the type of storyteller who is keen on hand holding, and it’s refreshing to see a riveting movie that’s made for thinking audiences.'], ['90%', ""The cinematic masterpiece that is Oppenheimer leaves an indelible impression on anyone who watches it. Christopher Nolan has truly outdone himself with this film, delivering a poignant message about the horrors of nuclear war. The superb direction and exceptional performances by Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. and others draw you into the story, making you feel as though you are right there in the midst of it all. Even though there aren't any action scenes, the movie still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat for its entire 3-hour runtime. Oppenheimer is a biopic that everyone knows the ending to, but thanks to the expert direction and awe-inspiring performances, it is an experience that will leave a lasting impression on you.""], ['100%', ""Oppenheimer: I feel like I have blood on my hands, sir.\nTruman: [takes a handkerchief from his pocket and gives it to him] You think anyone in Hiroshima or Nagasaki gives a shit about who built the bomb?\nan incredibly well-written and extremely well-acted piece of dramatic cinema about the very eventful and complicated life of J. Robert Oppenheimer and it is beautiful. I'm actually surprised this is a huge summer blockbuster.\nanytime Christopher Nolan releases a film, it's obviously an event all around the world because he's made tons of great films and he's one of the very few film-makers working today who really cares about cinema and values that cinematic experience. he's also one of the very few people who's actually given a budget to support his love for cinema. he shoots on film, does everything practically, he wants as little CGI as possible and he has apparently claimed that there isn't a single CGI shot in this film. if that's actually the case, like if he hasn't even included cleanup shots in the film, then my spirit just left my body. it's astounding.\nwent into this film with very limited knowledge about the life of Oppenheimer. like most people, I only knew him as The Father of the Atomic Bomb and the famous lines he quoted from the Bhagavad Gita which are Now I Am Become Death, The Destroyer of Worlds where he's talking about the atomic bomb realising the gravity of his creation and having to live with the sin of his achievement. I had no other knowledge about him as a person, his life outside of the invention, and the events that followed before or after it. so, if you're going into this film expecting an explosion porn, you're most likely to get disappointed having to sit through 3 hours' worth of heavy dramatic dialogue involving moments of genuinely terrifying character development. the film is about the person whose most pivotal moment in life was the success of The Manhattan Project. getting to experience being inside that person's mind as he's trying to visualize all these things combined with an incredible score by Ludwig Göransson and watching all of these rated-R, 3-hour, dialogue-heavy, beautifully shot on film by the master himself Hoyte van Hoytema with black and white sequences in a fucking theatre made me feel like I wasn't in 2023.\nthe performances are excellent. there really is no other word for it. from the top all the way down to the bottom of the incredibly huge cast list, there isn't a single weak link. Robert Downey Jr. is simply terrific. I haven't seen him like this since Kiss Kiss Bang Bang which came all the way back in 2005. I love him as Iron Man but that's more about the character rather than him as an actor. I wouldn't be shocked if he's nominated for a best supporting actor performance. Emily Blunt is also just really really great. there is a sequence early on in the film where Oppenheimer is being questioned and she's just sitting back there in the scene, out of focus. we're not even shown a close-up of her during this entire sequence until it becomes relevant later on in the film and we go back to that sequence when we finally realise the significance of her being there. Nolan has done quite a lot of that in this film actually. major A-list actors are in the film for like 2 scenes and then they never appear again. that's not just a testament to the actors who'd give anything to be in a Nolan-directed film but a testament to Nolan himself, as a film-maker. if we go back to the same sequence I mentioned earlier with Blunt, that's not just anyone sitting there, it's Emily Blunt. a phenomenal actress. but that's what gives the film a sense of groundedness. that the people on-screen are actual people, they behave like people. and for a certain amount of time, allows those celebrities to feel like normal people. Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Rami Malek, Jason Clarke, Dane DeHaan, I can go on and on but literally everyone is fucking phenomenal. the real star of the show though, is Cillian Murphy. in his first lead role for a Nolan film after having worked with him for almost 20 years, Murphy shines brighter than the atomic bomb itself and walks with suave leaving not just two, but a multitude of shockwaves. his work is beyond phenomenal here. he not only looks like Oppenheimer but every scene he's in, he's just instantly captivating. it's not just his incredible eyes (which go so deep that I just wanna sink myself in them) but, he's just always in character. never did I once see the guy from Red Eye or from Peaky Blinders. it was always Oppie.\nI'm actually putting this review as I listen to the absolutely bonkers score that has been provided for the film. Göransson's work is truly, awesome-tacularly, riveting. my heart was beating so fast in some sequences that have this heavy, beating sounds that I could almost have a seizure. the work here is truly remarkable.\nanother aspect of this film that shines brighter than ever is its editing. this is a 3-hour film that feels like 2 and a half. a half-an-hour of time just evaporated for me. every scene ends perfectly. there is no room for baggage. several big moments of history fly away in an instant. this gives the film a really focused feel. it gives the audience a cue that this is not the story of the world but it is the story of Oppenheimer. Nolan really knows how to edit his films such that they have just the right runtime and I really appreciate when a film-maker does that. it very much also gives this film that documentary-esque aspect and gets you convinced that these events actually did happen and this is not just some made-up story about a man's life.\nthis film is truly a marvelous achievement not just for Christopher Nolan himself as a filmmaker but for cinema as a whole. peak dramatic cinema. watch this on the biggest screen possible and the loudest speakers you can find.""], ['-', 'excellent, a perfect example of true defined cinema\nAt a whopping three hours long it, very much like LOTR, feels considerably less.\nA must watch']]"

However, I would say that anyone who has seen some of his recent work including his performance in “The Lighthouse” would be playing him a disservice by saying he was not up to the part.\nIn “The Batman”, audiences are given a darker and more broken Bruce Wayne, an Emo recluse who is far from the Socialite he has been portrayed as for decades and a very sullen and withdrawn individual who does not exude charm or grace and even shows issues making eye-contact.\nWhen the Mayor of Gotham is killed shortly before the election by a mysterious individual known as “The Riddler” (Paul Dano), the vigilante known as “The Batman” is called in to help the police by Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright).  Gordon has been working with Batman for some time but it is clear that his association with him has not won him any favors with his fellow officers, many of which openly question his use and involvement in the crime scenes.\nFurther complicating matters are clues left at the various crime locales that are addressed to The Batman and cause many to believe that he may be working with the very killer they are attempting to stop.\nAs the investigation unfolds, the seedy side of Gotham City comes to light in the form of a missing girl who was photographed with the married Mayor and may well be the key to the investigation. Her disappearance leads her friend Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), to take on her Catwoman persona and delve deep into an underworld that features deadly individuals ranging from Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), and The Penguin (Colin Farrell), amongst others as she and the Batman conduct their own investigations that at times overlap and further complicate matters.\nAs the body count rises and Batman races to find the true method behind the madness of The Riddler, the tone becomes darker and more sinister in a deadly race against time.\nThe film eschews the usual abundance of action sequences and glossy special effects which are common for Comic Book related films and instead gives audiences a slow-burning murder mystery that holds your attention from start to finish over its three-hour run time.\nThe dark and foreboding tone of the film is brought home by the haunting and sharp piano keys of the film’s theme that permeates the film and punches home that this is a film clearly aimed at a more adult audience.\nPattinson does a great job showing the deeply broken individual that is behind the mask and that Batman is the only form of escape or therapy that Bruce Wayne has due to his insistence on saving a city that many argue cannot be saved. He has strained his relationship at times with Alfred (Andy Serkis), caused damage to the financial stability and reputation of the family company in his quest for vengeance and justice, and has become a bitter and broken recluse in doing so. In many ways, it could be argued that his only socialization with others is as The Batman and his single-minded obsession is chilling to watch.\nPattinson also handles the action sequences well as the film spaces them out to put the emphasis more on the man than the gadgets as they are kept to a minimum even during a thrilling chase with the new version of The Batmobile.\nThe strong supporting cast works well with the film and Paul Dano gives a very compelling and disturbing version of his character which makes the film even darker and more engrossing.\nDirector Matt Reeves has crafted a dark and foreboding tone and visual style as a good portion of the film takes place in the darkness and his screenplay is not afraid to take chances by putting the emphasis on the characters and their flaws versus an abundance of action and effects.\nI found this version of the character and interpretation more engrossing than prior versions of the film as the bold move to do a slow-burning and dark murder mystery versus an effect-laden action film reminded me of some of the better Batman stories such as Batman: The Killing Joke or Batman: The Long Halloween.\nThe film is not going to be for everyone, especially younger viewers and some may take issue with the casting choices, but their performances shine and as such, “The Batman” was a very engaging and unforgettable tale that for me serves as one of the best adaptations of the character ever.\n4 stars out of 5'], ['80%', ""The reviews and hype for this movie were massive!

The film deserves credit for prominently shining the spotlight on the underbelly of crime in Gotham, but the storytelling in The Batman is a lot like Bugs Bunny meaning to have taken that left turn at Albuquerque; a meandering foray down a dark rabbit hole that isn’t entirely necessary.\nFull review: https://hubpages.com/entertainment/The-Batman-2022-Review-When-is-a-Bat-Not-Quite-a-Bat'], ['100%', 'Masterpiece.

This is the definitive live-action Batman. An epic 3-hour film noir that delves deep into comic lore of Gotham City.\nRobert Pattinson perfectly embodies both Bruce Wayne and Batman. I love the character arc he goes through, realizing Gotham doesn\'t need vengeance to heal, but hope. Zoë Kravitz plays a phenomenal Selina Kyle, you actually feel her emotions throughout the movie. Another plus is that she actually feels integral to the plot (unlike The Dark Knight Rises). Paul Dano is a terrifyingly realistic interpretation of The Riddler, using the internet to gain a fan base for his sick games. Andy Serkis plays an excellent Alfred, being Bruce\'s emotional support during Dark times.\nThe soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is absolute God-Tier. Elevating every scene with emotion and sometimes dread. Finally a score to rival Danny Elfman\'s iconic score. Matt Reeves direction is impeccable as always, getting some nice shots while also making it feel nice and claustrophobic around Batman.\nOverall, a God-Tier Batman movie that I can\'t wait for the Cinematic Universe that\'s being made around it as I type this.'], ['90%', ""It's a cracker, no doubt about it!\nMatt Reeves did a great job with 2022's 'The Batman'. It's difficult not to compare this to other Batman films, though that's DC/Warner Bros. fault for featuring him so much in recent times. I'll get this out the way early: I'd say 'Batman Begins'/'The Dark Knight' are superior, not by much, which is a similar case for the character performances too.\nRobert Pattinson is a terrific Bruce Wayne, though Christian Bale still edges him out in my eyes. Zoë Kravitz is probably the best Catwoman I've seen, though the rest - from the Riddler to Penguin to Alfred - have been portrayed better; aside from Commissioner Gordon, with Jeffrey Wright being excellent. Paul Dano is the least enjoyable performer, for me, here, I found his showing to be a bit 'meh' - effective, but meh. Barry Keoghan makes a cameo, I won't say as who, but I don't hold high hopes for him in that role; though, apparently it won't be anything that happens anyway. For the best!\nAnyway... the above sounds way too negative - as I did thoroughly and absolutely enjoy this film, hence the very positive rating. The pacing is very good, the cinematography is brilliant (Gotham looks fantastically bleak!), the story is engrossing and the dialogue is on point. The scenes with Pattinson/Kravitz and Pattinson/Wright are my favourite moments. It's a film that I'd consider as 'outstanding'.\nIt'll be cool to see what Reeves does with this trilogy (should it happen, of course).""], ['80%', 'I like how Batman is depicted with a naive and loser POV from his rich high tower, a rich trust fund baby called out by both sane (Catwoman) and insane (Riddler) people while he remains oblivious until the consequences are literally flooding the city. While he uses the idea of Batman as a mantle for him to process trauma, his obliviousness to his own celebrity status and image creates unintentional side effects from his parents\' death hogging the spotlight away from the people that mattered to his own nebulous idea of ""vengeance"" being co-opted by the goons, a heel-turn realization that eventually changes the rack focus, ultimately leading to a wider perspective and a selfless act of cutting the cord and helping others. Hope is more important than his idea of justice, in the end, empathy being the missing piece throughout. Instead of being a voyeur like Riddler during his master plan (Riddler binoculars on the mayor, Batman binoculars on Catwoman), he switches to being on the ground to help, no longer from his high castle.\nIt\'s interesting how this arc plays out. At the beginning, it plays into this ""badass"" idea comic book fans love to gloat about Batman of striking fear into crime, but the way it\'s portrayed is frightening to everyone. It\'s a better criticism of Batman\'s fascism than BvS was going for, showcasing his fear to people who don\'t even deserve it, such as kids doing vandalism who probably believe the system is failing them, but to him at the beginning crime all looks the same.\nHonestly this film goes harder than Phantasm on the tragedy that is Bruce Wayne. They\'re inseparable by choice, to the point that Bruce basically is Batman even when not in the costume, a social recluse who can barely function in real life, listening to emo music and having rings around his eyes, a night owl to the extreme. The struggle is there even as Batman, literally smashing his face on a truck.\nThere are some contradictions throughout thematically, however. It\'s weird how it goes between ""it\'s the WHOLE system, all cops are pigs"" to ""it\'s just bad apples"" simultaneously, displaying a somewhat cringe centrism. Catwoman by the end basically points it more to systemic (and Batman and Thomas Wayne\'s criticism of thinking they know better and actually makings things worse isn\'t undercut, which by itself is also institutional criticism), although it still feels like they could\'ve done more. Maybe out of their hands by the studio or this as far as they could get away with vs. the producers (it almost felt like a struggle for Catwoman to outline her ""eat the rich"" mentality). Gotham itself is a mess of contradictions and it\'s OK to let the viewer lie between it all I guess.\nAlso the relationship between Catwoman and Batman is kinda slimy and male-centric. Catwoman, while great as a character, functionally falls to Batman\'s controlling force with a forced romance in the second act. Sure they\'re both suffering from trauma but Batman was literally using her despite it all, it at least understands the power gap more in the third act.\nThe end of the second act also spins its wheels a bit too much, the mystery pace kinda suffers a bit from focus and scenes get too drawn out (Riddler just disappears for a while). The movie could\'ve been 20 minutes shorter. Doesn\'t stop it from having a terrific third act since most blockbusters have kinda sucked on that note\nAlthough speaking of Riddler, master class. Probably my favorite villain in a Batman film.\nThe aesthetic was gorgeous. I love its color grading and architecture, still thinking of the Wayne tower and its metal grates, goth hallways, and insane attention to detail that gets blurred out intentionally in the frame for most of the movie by Bruce\'s obliviousness to the world. It also keeps a balance of evoking the black/white movies while still being colorful, more of flooded black and oranges. I think of that sequence with Penguin not mainly for the fight itself (which to me was a bit messy) but moreso the flooded orange of the fire being the only color creating a sorta gradient on the black car, and how the flare at the end matches that aesthetic, that one color illuminating Batman leading everybody else to exit the frame, like a light in the darkness. Lovely\nThe music.... Giacchino just beat out his Incredibles score for me, masterful work with motifs, percussion, and rhythm. His mastery of percussion and horns during the lights out Batman hallway fight and how the horns blast, how well edited the percussion beat subtly goes through the Penguin chase and other fight sequences, Batman doesn\'t quite have a dance like Hong Kong films but the music makes it come close. The timpani and strings are so well used!!! Great use of Ave Maria both as soundtrack and score. Catwoman\'s motif? Amazing.\nThe performances are great all around. Finally a film with Turturro that I don\'t hate him. He\'s well restrained and perfectly cast, his dickish attitude now a strong point making him very memorable with very little screen time, much like Farrell in the same film. Kravitz made me the closest to tearing up with how she visually handles conflicting emotions, I still think about that scene with the voicemail where her eyes are all over the place and has trouble keeping it all together. Dano as Riddler is terrific.\nYep, this is my fav Batman film now.'], ['100%', ""This film is so intricate, there's so many details, things you can obverse on multiple watches and not have noticed on your first. There's a lot of things that just aren't spoken that give this film so much substance. So many layers and nuanced story telling. Gotham City feels as it should, as it's own character and a visceral cesspool of corruption and just dirt. It feels dirty, unpolished... it's amazing.\nThere's so many shots in this film that are just simply breathtaking and intentionally dirty. It helps capture this visceral tone and fits substantially well with the universe of Batman.\nBeing a diehard fan of Batman for, like, pretty much all of my life- I have to say; Matt Reeves absolutely nailed it with a completely faithful adaptation of Batman. Not once in this movie did he do something I felt was completely out of character and Robert Pattinson solidified the performance of both Bruce Wayne and the Batman. I love Matt Reeves went to the extent to make sure this Batman doesn't kill, as other directors have seem to give less care to. Yes, even Nolan. It should have to go without saying that Batman does not kill, that's a no-brainer, but for decades this has been a problem in Batman films... and finally, it no longer is a problem. That's how you do it.\nBringing this review to a conclusion, this is easily my favourite Batman film. So many things about this film just feel like it's pulled straight out of a comic book. I mean, Riddler flooding the city itself is pulled straight from Zero Year and there's so many nods to comic moments and members of Batman's rouges gallery. Matt Reeves knew what he was doing, and he crafted this film for diehard Batman fans, succeeding immensely.

The film is a complex mass because it is as if The Batman, The Batman 2 and 3 had been compressed and I am not only talking about the exhausting time of almost 3 hours, but also because of the number of common threads in which it was woven into a single feature film. For example, the plot increases its complexity first with a Riddler who is an anti-hero, because he indirectly helps Batman and the supposed common good and because of the premises that justify his murders, unmasking the big shots of the underworld at high levels of government, but later, arrested as Edward Nashton, he unmasks himself, that is, he turns himself in, sitting in that cafeteria just when, then yes, we will understand his ""fine"" intentions, and he becomes a true public order villain because he incites the revenge to the uncritical masses and followers of the disorder who have suffered or have resentments for any type of discrimination or corruption that they have suffered in Gotham city, (no more and no less than similar to the end of Todd Phillips\' Joker);another complexity is with the cat The cat, I will not say Catwoman, who has her own drama for Kyle and at some point Batman leans on her, to spy on the Prosecutor and at least 2 times saves her from murdering her father Carmine Falcone and the his father\'s henchman. On the other hand, there is the added density or complexity of transcending and publishing the videos that show that the mother of Bruce Wayne, the mother of Batman had psychiatric problems in Arkham and hospitals and comes from a family that descendants who also had these difficulties and Thomas Wayne , trying to silence the journalist, he used the biggest thug Falcone. In other words, there is a possibility that Falcone, Catwoman\'s stepfather, is the one who murdered the Waynes that night because Batman\'s father was about to pity or denounce the next day that he only wanted to silence the journalist and NOT murder him as Falcone did. . In short, it is entertaining but poorly planned for a single feature film due to the enormous amount of detail that is handled.']]"

Nothing here makes me want to work things out; it's forgettable. Sure, you can say this has to be seen on the big screen, but the long runtime makes it unappealing to most mainstream audiences. Unfortunately, 'Tenet' is not here to save the 2020 box office. I work at a cinema, and to say it underperformed well would be correct. We are going to see more 'Tenet' hot-take YouTube videos than thinkpiece/what you missed ones. Christopher Nolan has made his most forgettable film to date - it's not a bad movie and I'm sure his diehard fans will adore this one, but for everyone else, there isn't much here. 'Tenet' won't be remembered as another “groundbreaking visual spectacle“ from Nolan or for “saving cinema“. It will be remembered for its weird release schedule and having been shown during a global pandemic, and that's unfortunate. Like the rest of the year, 'Tenet' is a write-off.\nRead Chris' full article...\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-tenet-time-runs-up-like-my-enjoyment-of-nolans-latest-film""], ['80%', 'If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\nChristopher Nolan has delivered some of my favorite movies of the century. All the way from Memento to the most recent Dunkirk, I\'ve yet to dislike one of his films, so expectations are always high with him. The current global pandemic closed movie theaters worldwide, but fortunately, some countries already opened them, including my own. My IMAX screening of Tenet was my first trip to a theater since February! As a firm believer and strong advocate of the so-called ""cinematic experience"", I would always remember fondly the day I returned to a place I hold very close to my heart independently of my opinion about the film. Nevertheless, it became an even more special day once I left that enormous screen behind with a happy face.\nNowadays, people complain about everything, especially on social media. So, I\'m not surprised that the ""savior of cinema"" marketing tagline triggered so many souls. If Nolan didn\'t have enough haters, it surely got a few more after this campaign. Me? I look at it like any other marketing scheme: it\'s intended to hype its own movie, so I don\'t really understand why this specific publicity caused so much controversy. Obviously, ""savior of cinema"" doesn\'t mean Nolan is going to save theaters from dying. It\'s just a tagline trying to hype the first major blockbuster in several months! It\'s a marketing strategy to try and convince people to give Tenet a go. If there\'s a film meant to be seen at the biggest screen possible, this is the one.\nI\'ll get the outstanding technical achievements out of the way. Inception and Interstellar boast impressive visuals that are hard to compete with, but Tenet is up to the challenge. With uniquely complex, stunning, grand set pieces, Nolan delivers riveting action based on a mind-blowing temporal concept that will make every single viewer scratch their heads. I lost count to the number of times I tried to open my eyes more so I could see (and understand) everything that was going on. Hoyte van Hoytema\'s cinematography is handheld for a lot of action sequences, and he has such control over his craft that he was able to capture some of the most jaw-dropping action moments of the last few years through gorgeous angles and a firm grip.\nNolan said that Tenet would be ""the hardest movie to cut"" for any editor. Jennifer Lame\'s editing plays a vital role in the time inversion sequences. It\'s relatively easy to imagine how brutal of a task she must have had. She\'s incredibly consistent throughout the runtime with perfectly timed cuts that elevate even the simplest of scenes. I wish I could be more specific, but in order to avoid spoilers, I\'ll just write this: she has a bunch of nominations coming her way, including an Academy Award. Ludwig Göransson\'s score is tremendously powerful, and it definitely adds to the magnificent action set pieces, especially in the third act.\nFinally, Nathan Crowley (production designer) creates such a realistic look that it almost made me believe this could actually occur in the real world. CGI has come a long way, and it\'s indisputably a tool that can completely transform films into something fascinating when used correctly. However, practical effects will always offer a feeling impossible to replicate through computerized images. It\'s probably the aspect I appreciate the most about this movie: its massive application of practical effects and real stunts. It surrounds the physics-defying premise within a bubble of realism, and that\'s only achieved with talented people in the right technical departments.\nStory-wise... this is where it gets tricky. I have to be honest about my experience: I found it surprisingly okay to follow and not that challenging to understand. This doesn\'t mean that it isn\'t a remarkably complex, layered narrative with ideas that will be incredibly hard for some people to comprehend. I\'m not trying to patronize anyone, far from that, but some viewers will inevitably leave the theater without completely understanding what they just saw, simply because it\'s a two-hour-and-a-half movie packed with heavy exposition about a fictional quantum physics concept. For example, in the same way that some people genuinely can\'t have a 3D perspective, other people will also have visual difficulties in distinguishing the inverted sequences.\nThe need to be vague about plot details doesn\'t let me explain a lot, but the unique concept Nolan develops in Tenet is undoubtedly an exceptionally intriguing idea. As crazy as it might sound, I found the visuals more confusing than the actual scientific explanations that they go with. Unfortunately, that\'s one of my main issues with the film. Throughout the entire runtime, there\'s an excessive load of exposition about the time shenanigans. It\'s a massive amount of information for anyone to be able to remember every single detail. Even worse, some dialogue sequences feel so incredibly forced that it\'s almost like the movie stops for quick breaks where the characters explain something directly to the audience.\nThis last point leads me to another problem. John David Washington gets better and better as time goes by, but he feels like a mediator between the film and the audience for the first half of the movie. His dialogue revolves around asking questions about what\'s happening and how the time inversion works, which is obviously understandable given the character\'s circumstances, but the execution of these conversations lacks that spontaneous vibe. It really feels like someone yelled ""Action!"", the actors did their lines, and that same someone yelled ""Cut!"". Washington isn\'t exactly a worldwide, well-known actor (Ballers, BlackKklansman), and this is his first big blockbuster appearance, so his inexperience didn\'t help him through these moments.\nHowever, he ends up being a fine protagonist (no pun intended). Robert Pattinson is charming and quite funny, actually. I couldn\'t avoid the ""humorless"" review headlines, and being totally honest, it\'s surprisingly a lot funnier than I thought it would (not) be. His character has a vital role in the whole story, and it\'s through him that most of the knowledge about the intricate concept at hand is developed. Elizabeth Debicki is probably the spotlight stealer, though. With a remarkable performance, she represents the emotional arc of the film, and she delivers one of her best interpretations ever. I was afraid that her storyline would turn into a forced romance, but fortunately, it only helped build Washington\'s character traits.\nOn the other hand, Kenneth Branagh plays a cliche Russian bad guy with generic motivations who feels way too formulaic for such a ground-breaking movie. But ultimately, that\'s what Nolan presents. His astonishingly talented methods as a director and his obsession with detail as a writer make Tenet a certainly flawed yet phenomenal film with a concept that might be the hardest he\'s ever had to pull off. As long as people can remove themselves from the real world and enter a whole new one with entirely different mechanisms and rules, it will be the so-called ""blockbuster of the summer"" that everyone deserves this year.\nAll in all, Tenet undoubtedly boasts an incredibly complex narrative with a unique temporal concept impressively demonstrated through spectacular, loud, jaw-dropping, practical action set pieces. Christopher Nolan is a masterful director and a fascinating writer, but he has to thank its technical crew for creating such a visually stunning blockbuster. From Hoyte van Hoytema\'s riveting camera work to Jennifer Lame\'s seamless editing, passing through Ludwig Göransson\'s powerful score and Nathan Crowley\'s beautiful production design, Tenet is one of the most technically mind-blowing movies of the last few years. With the help of a remarkable cast (especially Debicki and Pattinson), the definitely intriguing story makes the epic runtime feel a bit shorter, despite some scenes being unnecessary. The heavy and forced exposition throughout the entire film transforms an otherwise entertaining flick into a fictional physics class that will confuse thousands of viewers. It also doesn\'t help to have a generic MacGuffin and a formulaic villain at the core of such an unconventional movie. In the end, Nolan isn\'t the ""savior of cinema"" (no one will be), but he certainly delivers the blockbuster everyone\'s been waiting for since the beginning of the year. As long as people are able to accept and enter his new world, Tenet will be received as one of the best films of 2020.\nRating: A-'], ['90%', 'There is a moment midway through this film where you can suddenly feel everything clicking into place. Up until this point, the film has been entertaining, with some great set pieces and a scope that is trademark Nolan, but the central hook of the film - “time inversion” - has felt almost superfluous to the plot, albeit a clever visual conceit that gives the film a different vibe to your average spy thriller. But then comes the “moment” - a simple act of crossing a threshold - where suddenly you realise how the visual conceit is going to figure into the rest of the film and also how most of the first hour has been pure setup for what is to follow. It’s the kind of twist that isn’t really a twist at all as it is a visual explanation that the film has really been waiting for. Nolan has taken quite a gamble in delaying this “moment” for so long and there is always the feeling the film is hiding elements of the plot in the first half. This means the explanation may have come too late for some to invest in the film fully, but if you are still with it, there is a sudden feeling of exhilaration of knowing to an extent some of what is about to follow and the film lets loose with some fantastic set pieces that are hugely satisfying if you have been paying attention.\nPerformances are great, with Branagh in full scenery chewing mode and the score is suitably Zimmeresque and loud. It doesn’t quite hit the highs of its closest cousin - Inception - but it’s scope is similarly impressive and it’s going to lead to plenty of theories and explanations in order to follow each major character’s journey through the film. Great stuff in the end, but it was touch and go there for a while.'], ['100%', 'I was recently asked if this was better or worse than Inception. \n Personally, I don’t think you can compare any of his films outside the fact that he made them.

More precisely, the laws of science are unchanged under the combination of operations (or symmetries) known as C, P, and T (C means changing particles for antiparticles. P means taking the mirror image, so left and right are interchanged. And T means reversing the direction of motion of all particles: in effect, running the motion backward). The laws of science that govern the behaviour of matter under all normal situations are unchanged under the combination of the two operations C and P on their own. In other words, life would be just the same for the inhabitants of another planet who were both mirror images of us and who were made of antimatter, rather than matter.\nIf the laws of science are unchanged by the combination of operations C and P, and also by the combination C, P, and T, they must also be unchanged under the operation T alone. Yet there is a big difference between the forward and backward directions of real time in ordinary life. Imagine a cup of water falling off a table and breaking into pieces on the floor. If you take a film of this, you can easily tell whether it is being run forward or backward. If you run it backward you will see the pieces suddenly gather themselves together off the floor and jump back to form a whole cup on the table. You can tell that the film is being run backward because this kind of behaviour is never observed in ordinary life.\nThe explanation that is usually given as to why we don\'t see broken cups gathering themselves together off the floor and jumping back onto the table is that it is forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics. This says that in any closed system, disorder, or entropy, always increases with time. In other words, it is a form of Murphy\'s law: things always tend to go wrong! An intact cup on the table is a state of high order, but a broken cup on the floor is a disordered state. One can go readily from the cup on the table in the past to the broken cup on the floor in the future, but not the other way round.\nImagine you and a friend decide to go to Pisa, with one of you standing atop the famous leaning tower and the other located down at the bottom. From the top, whoever throws a ball off the edge can easily predict where it will land down on the bottom. Yet if the person at the bottom were to throw the ball upwards with an equal-and-opposite velocity to the ball that just landed, it would arrive exactly at the location where the person at the top threw their ball from.\nThis is a situation where time-reversal invariance holds: where the T-symmetry is unbroken. Time reversal can be thought of the same way as motion reversal: if the rules are the same whether you run the clock forwards or backwards, there\'s true T-symmetry. But if the rules are different when the clock runs backwards from when the clock runs forwards, the T-symmetry must be broken.\nWatching Tenet, the latest film from writer/producer/director Christopher Nolan (Memento; Inception; Interstellar), I was reminded of an apocryphal story about NASA – during the space race, in an attempt to tackle the problem of how to write in zero gravity, NASA poured millions into developing the Fisher Space Pen, whereas the Russians simply gave their cosmonauts pencils. And it seems to me watching this overblown mess of a film that Nolan has become so fixated on the grandiosity of the pen that he has completely overlooked the humble pencil. More so than any of his previous work, Tenet is focused on mixing philosophy and real(ish) science with over-the-top mainstream entertainment to such an extent that he ignores such basic narrative principles as character arcs, empathy, motivation, and interiority. Now, don\'t get me wrong, I love filmic experimentation (two of my favourite directors are Terrence Malick and David Lynch), but Tenet isn\'t an especially experimental film – it\'s a humourless and badly written shambles, convinced of its own portentousness, and created by a man who has achieved such popularity that it seems no one in his circle is willing to tell him when something is a bad idea.\nSpending almost ten years working on the story, and five writing the script, in Tenet, Nolan is yet again examining the vagaries of time. It\'s a theme that\'s front and centre in Memento (2000), Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014), and Dunkirk (2017), and to a lesser extent in Following (1998) and The Prestige (2006) (I haven\'t seen any of his Dark Knight trilogy so I can\'t attest to their thematic concerns, and we shall not speak of his remake of Insomnia). It\'s undeniably fascinating to see a tent pole Hollywood production engaging with issues such as entropy, thermodynamics, reversibility and irreversibility, time\'s arrow, the grandfather paradox, and T-symmetry, all the while keeping proceedings housed firmly within the spy genre (it\'s a Bond movie in all but name). Indeed, one of the film\'s central questions is especially noteworthy – if what and who we remember from our past defines who we are in our present, do things that haven\'t happened to us yet also speak to our identity? Do our future actions determine who we are as much as our past actions? It\'s a fascinating question. And one with which Nolan does precisely nothing. However, the film\'s main problems aren\'t related to the squandered existential potential, the much-ballyhooed complexity, the puzzle-like structure, the philosophical musing, or the thematic similarity to Nolan\'s previous work. Rather, they are more fundamental, existing almost entirely at a structural level (although some of the performances don\'t help matters, nor does the abysmal sound mixing). The film looks incredible, the practical effects in the action scenes are extraordinarily mounted, the cinematography is stunning, and the editing is superb, but there simply isn\'t anything of note under the shiny veneer. It\'s a film with virtually no interest in human beings.\nThe premise of Tenet is straightforward in outline. The film opens as a CIA operative known only as The Protagonist (John David Washington) infiltrates a team of bad guys looking to find a spy at the Kiev Opera House. He finds the man before they do, but during their escape, he sees something which should be impossible – a bullet seems to travel backwards in space and a bullet hole is ""un-shot"", as if time is reversed for that bullet, even though everything else is moving normally. The Protagonist is able to smuggle the spy outside, but their escape goes awry, and to avoid being captured, he swallows a cyanide tablet. Rather than dying, however, he awakens to be told that he has passed the test to join an ultra-secret international espionage squad known as Tenet. His mission is fairly simply – at some point in the future, someone has figured out how to reverse the entropy of objects, effectively being able to send them back along the timeline without having to reverse time itself. The implications of this are catastrophic and have set humanity on course for World War III, and probable extinction, unless The Protagonist can figure out who is doing it and put a stop to their machinations. Along the way, he makes the acquaintance of Neil (Robert Pattinson), his infinitely better-informed handler; Andrei Sator (a spectacularly miscast Kenneth Branagh giving new meaning to clichéd villainy), a dangerous Russian oligarch; Kat Barton (Elizabeth Debicki), Andrei\'s oppressed and deeply unhappy trophy wife; Priya (Dimple Kapadia), an arms dealer; Ives (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), a Tenet soldier; Michael Crosby (Michael Caine), a British intelligence bigwig; and Barbara (Clémence Poésy), a scientist specialising in all things temporal.\nTenet is an event movie in every way; this 150-minute, $200m+ original idea (when was the last time a non-franchise, non-comic book original movie got that kind of budget) is a massive studio tent pole written and directed by the most popular filmmaker alive. And I will say this. The budget is on the screen. Oftentimes, you\'ll see a movie that\'s cost a ridiculous amount and you\'ll sit there thinking, ""they must have spent a lot on catering."" With Tenet, however, it\'s all there, front and centre. No small amount of that money, of course, must have gone on the practical effects (incredibly, the film has only 280 vfx shots) – whether it be our heroes bungie-jumping onto the side of a building, a close-quarters fight where one of the combatants moves in reverse, a Boeing 747 jet crashing into a building (which was shot for real), a highway chase where some of the cars are going forward in time and others are going backwards, or an all-out battle scene where, again, some of the soldiers travel forward whilst others move in reverse. Even Ludwig Göransson\'s score gets in on the act, employing only melodies which sound the same whether played backwards or forwards.\nAs cinematic spectacle goes (on a purely visual level), I\'ve never quite seen anything like it. It\'s one of those films where you\'ll genuinely be asking yourself, ""how the hell did they do that?""; a question that\'s become increasingly rare in our CGI-reliant times. Tenet looks like it was an exceptionally difficult movie to make. Along the same lines, the cinematography by the great Hoyte van Hoytema (The Fighter; Spectre; Ad Astra) is stunning, with van Hoytema mixing 15-perf 70mm IMAX film (shot at 1.43:1; projected at 1.90:1) with traditional 70mm stock (2.20:1) and a few 35mm sequences in a manner where the shifts in aspect ratio are barely noticeable (although I saw it on an IMAX screen; aspects shifts would be more obvious on a smaller screen). It\'s the kind of film that could only exist in the medium of cinema – no other artform could even begin to approximate its aesthetic design and splendour, and I admire that a great deal. A celluloid purist, Nolan has always made a big stink about the artistic importance of cinema, and Tenet finds him pushing the aesthetic boundaries of what the artform can accomplish, foregrounding innovation in ways that big budget mainstream studio productions simply don\'t, and celebrating the possibilities it affords those with sufficient enough imagination.\nUnfortunately, no matter how visually unique or aesthetically impressive it may be, no amount of gloss can hide the fact that the screenplay is a turgid mess and suffers from some fundamental problems – most notably, it\'s bereft of emotion and populated with cardboard cut-outs that are supposed to be characters. The problems start early when The Protagonist is told that the future of humanity depends on his mission. This is precisely when I started to tune out. Any film that declares its story is none-other than saving humanity has gone so big as to render the people who populate its narrative as insignificant. It\'s also a cliché, it\'s dull as dishwater, and we\'ve seen it done a million-and-one-times. The idea of saving all mankind simply doesn\'t pack any kind of emotional punch any more, far better to stay smaller and focus on character.\nWhich brings me to those characters. Good lord, they\'re badly written. The Protagonist isn\'t a person with an interiority; he\'s a cipher, the audience\'s surrogate so that Nolan can explain the plot to us. But there\'s nothing more to him – he\'s utterly emotionless, seemingly void of any kind of relatable motivation, has no psychological through line, and nothing even resembling a character arc. I\'m not a huge fan of Washington in general, who I feel has played every part in the same sombre, disinterested manner, so there could be some prejudice at work, but I am a huge fan of Branagh, and he\'s even worse. Think of the most clichéd Russian villain you\'ve ever seen. Now square that and you\'ll be some way towards imagining how ludicrous Sator is. He isn\'t a person – he\'s a collection of near-satirical tics, clichés, and elements from other, better films. Maybe with a more menacing actor in the role it might have worked, but all I could think whenever he was on screen was ""that accent is hilarious."" Pattinson\'s Neil and Debicki\'s Kat fair better, but neither set the screen alight. Along the same lines, much of the second half of the film hinges on the fact that The Protagonist and Kat find themselves drawn to one another, yet Washington and Debicki have zero chemistry. At a human level, there\'s nothing to take a hold of the audience, nothing to make us care about any of these people; they\'re gears in the machinery of Nolan\'s plot.\nSpeaking of Kat, a common criticism of Nolan\'s filmography as a whole is that his female characters tend to be victims whose deaths motivate men or who need saving by men, and/or women who define themselves almost entirely in terms of their relationship to men. Now, I\'m not saying that Nolan is obliged to write more rounded female characters. He isn\'t. Much like one of his favourite filmmakers, Michael Mann, Nolan\'s films are androcentric. And there\'s nothing wrong with that. However, in Mann, there are to be found strong female characters with considerable agency, whereas in Tenet, Kat is nothing more than a pawn in a game played by powerful men who effortlessly control her. She defines herself almost entirely in terms of her role as a self-sacrificing mother, and whilst this is an interesting trait the first couple of times it comes up, by the time Nolan is reminding us of how much she has sacrificed for the 237th time, it had become obvious that this was going to be the extent of her characterisation.\nAt one point early in the film, Barbara tells The Protagonist, ""don\'t try to understand it, just feel it"", which is advice that Nolan is also offering to his audience. The problem is that there\'s nothing to feel. Tenet is a puzzle, the impenetrability of which will depend on each individual viewer (and how much of the appallingly poorly-mixed dialogue you can make out), but unlike Memento (which remains Nolan\'s best by a long way), which packed a seriously emotional gut-punch when we finally learn what was at the heart of the puzzle, Tenet offers us nothing more than the task of deciphering it for its own sake. There\'s a twist towards the end that I literally saw coming from about 10 minutes in, but aside from that, there\'s no payoff. There\'s nothing to make us want to penetrate a story that seems more intent on reminding us how clever it is instead of trying to depict real people or establish real emotional stakes; it\'s a film more enamoured by the complexity of its own design than by any of the people contained within. It\'s an emotional void – all technical virtuosity and surface sheen with next to nothing at its core.'], ['100%', ""I believe Tenet is very underrated. This movie is just too good!

Also, we do not see any coherent story during the film and the events of the film do not form a script at all. There is no characterization in the film, the protagonist character is not made at all and is not believable, also the other characters are completely caricatured and extra, also during the film and its artificial communication, not a bit of feeling is created.

The opening and closing sequences of the film are highly artificial, and the final sequence is saturated with a large number of cuts, aerial shots and rudimentary special effects. The only slight positive aspect of the film is its acting, and the acting of the antagonist character is defensible.

Associate with shady beings? Sell your soul? Those are among the possibilities raised in the latest hair-raising smart horror/comedy from the writing-directing duo of Cameron and Colin Cairnes. This documentary-style offering presents the supposedly lost recording (complete with allegedly never-before-seen found footage) of a 1970s late night talk show hosted by comedian/TV personality Jack Delroy (David Dastmalchian) whose goal is to unseat Johnny Carson’s eminently popular Tonight Show as the premier after-hours choice of viewing. Delroy’s Night Owls broadcast is modestly successful, but it never manages to win the late night ratings race, so he desperately looks for ways to nudge his program over the top. When he decides to host a Halloween show with an array of occult/paranormal guests – capitalizing on a growing trend at the time – he believes he’s hit on the formula to achieve his goal. But, as the show progresses, he finds himself in over his head as events begin to spiral out of control. Viewers both on and off the screen are kept in suspense with a well-integrated blend of humor, high camp and unexpectedly spooky moments involving a hammy, self-righteous psychic medium (Fayssal Bazzi), an egomanical magician-turned-debunker (Ian Bliss), and an escaped teenage cult member (Ingrid Torelli) and her psychologist caregiver/surrogate parent (Laura Gordon). As things deteriorate, Jack tries to hold the show together with the aid of his producer (Josh Quong Tart) and flunky sidekick (Rhys Auteri). But, as the stakes are continually upped, that task grows ever more difficult, especially when supernatural influences begin to assert themselves in the studio, threatening both the broadcast and the fulfillment of the host’s long-cherished dream. Although occasional pacing issues, a periodically disjointed narrative and a somewhat overblown final act can get in the way of the smoothness of the story flow, these shortcomings are made up for by the film’s superb period piece production design, its clever writing and its fine performances, most notably that of the protagonist. And, in the end, it’s all served up with lots of laughs and a tidy moral of the story. Admittedly, “Late Night with the Devil” probably would have worked better as a Halloween release than a piece of springtime movie fare, but that doesn’t lessen the entertainment value of this inspired production, one thar shows horror flicks can indeed do more than just see how high it can make the final body count.'], ['60%', 'With his days of chasing Johnny Carson in the television ratings long gone, the now struggling and recently bereaved talk show host ""Jack Delroy"" (David Dastmalchian) is staring cancellation in the face. Then he and producer ""Leo"" (Josh Quong Tart) come up with an idea for a riveting Halloween special. The gist of what comes now purports to be an off-air recording of that lost transmission from 1977 - and it\'s quite literally hair raising. His first guest is a medium, his second an out-and-out sceptic and his third - well they have quite an unique claim to fame - and it\'s this last quarter of the film that comes ""alive"". Sadly, the rest of this feature is rather hampered by the constant (virtual) advertising breaks that completely suck the pace out of the thing. They are designed to, in monochrome, fill in a little of the back-stage machinations as the programme goes to air but for me, they just interrupted - far too frequently - the culmination of the truth or fake storyline. Dastmalchian does an half decent job here, but the plaudits really belong to Ian Bliss and his sarcastic ""Carmichael Haig"" character. He\'s the poacher-cum-gamekeeper cynic who has a ridiculing put down for just about everything that emanates from the other characters. Projectile vomiting or chair levitation - he has an plausible explanation. That\'s maybe part of the film\'s problem in general. Though set in the 1970s when these kind of visual effects were less prevalent, the whole thing just comes across as a perfectly plausible ratings-gathering gimmick. Whilst that\'s not necessarily a bad thing, it does rather rob the film of any pretence of horror or mystery. In fact, by the conclusion it seemed more designed to send up the whole principle of half-baked, late-night American television hosted by vain, ambitious but largely talentless men in suits.

Give it a shot.""], ['-', 'A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com\nThere’s an arbitrary sense of nostalgia that unfairly permeates audience perceptions of the new female-centric “Ghostbusters” reboot. I love the original 1984 film too; I wore out my VHS cassette when I was a kid and I’ve probably seen the movie dozens of times, including special theatrical re-releases and anniversary screenings. It’s almost as if all of this animosity is seen as a badge of honor for ‘serious movie fans.’\nAll of this badmouthing is truly unwarranted, especially if you actually go back and rewatch the original. Sure, the movie has comedy legend Bill Murray, the hilarious Rick Moranis, and memorable performances from Harold Ramis, Sigourney Weaver and Dan Aykroyd. It introduced us to the characters we all still love decades later, and made lines like “tell him about the Twinkie” a permanent part of movie nerd vocabulary. But to all the haters I say this: you are being very, very unfair. The 1980s era film has a lot of boring sequences and lags quite a bit, and as is the case with many movies, sometimes our nostalgia creates pretty thick rose colored glasses. We tend to only remember the good in our childhood favorites.\nPut aside your bias: the new “Ghostbusters” honors the legacy of the original, is a fun retelling of the classic story, and it does not disappoint. THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY! THIS MOVIE IS ACTUALLY GOOD!\nThere are a couple of minor hiccups along the way (as with most comedies, not every joke sticks, and the ghastly Missy Elliott / Fall Out Boy remake of the already awful Ray Parker Jr. song “Ghostbusters” makes an unwelcome appearance), but overall the movie is a success. At first it may feel weird to see women Ghostbusters but any skepticism will quickly fade (there’s a new generation of young girls who will undoubtedly be inspired by these characters).\nWhen estranged childhood friends and paranormal enthusiasts Erin (Kristen Wiig) and Abby (Melissa McCarthy) reunite, sparks are rekindled and they decide to get back to their ghost chasing roots. The smartypants duo is joined by weirdo nuclear engineer Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon) and subway worker Patty (Leslie Jones). When Manhattan starts to experience boatloads of specter activity, the friends get started on some good old fashioned poltergeist hunting.\nA big part of why this movie works is the comedic talent of these women; their chemistry is evident and they play well off each other, and the positive themes of loyalty and friendship never once feel fake. All of the actors are proficient at physical comedy and all have impeccable timing. This movie is very funny and the jokes had (and kept) me laughing from the beginning (there’s a particularly hilarious sequence at a heavy metal concert that’s worth the price of admission).\nRounding out the amusing performances is Chris Hemsworth as Kevin, a completely clueless stud muffin who is hired as the women’s receptionist solely based on his beefcake good looks. This feminist spin on the dumb secretary stereotype is exactly the type of lampoon I was hoping for here. In fact, the film doesn’t shy away from all of the lady haters either: there are lots of self-referential bits that directly address all of the critics (my favorite being Holtzmann’s ‘One of the Boys‘ t-shirt). Girl power!\nFans of the original will also appreciate several in-jokes and references, and there’s a long line of fun cameos (which I won’t spoil here: just keep your eyes open and be sure to stay through the end credits)! The special effects have been given a serious upgrade as well: these ghosts look real, feel real, and are appropriately scary-yet-funny. When the ladies first fired up their proton packs, I began cheering internally.\n“Ghostbusters” is exactly what a summer movie is supposed to be. It’s big in scope, it’s full of hearty laughs, it’s filled with terrific performances from all of the leads, it’s stuffed with stunning special effects, and it’s something the entire family can enjoy. All of you naysayers really need to lighten up because this is a really, really fun movie.\nA SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com'], ['-', 'Filmmaker Paul Feig\'s Ghostbusters reboot pretty much followed the characteristic aspects of his previous films (""Bridesmaids"", ""The Heat"", ""Spy"") all incorporating a self-awareness of female-oriented friendship and the estrogen-driven escapades rooted in inspired goofiness. So given this familiar foundation of Feig\'s big screen blueprint one would expect that his creative input into the continued Ghostbusters franchise for the millennium moviegoers would result in the heralded hype his film project is now enjoying at large. Sure, the feminine-charged Ghostbusters seemed like a radical concept and would obviously trigger the nostalgic sentiments (and comparisons) of the classic 80\'s comedy spearheaded by beloved on-screen paranormal hucksters Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson. Nevertheless, singer Ray Parker Jr.\'s lyrical catchphrase ""Who you gonna call?"" within the Ghostbusters theme song needs to be addressed accordingly. The answer: the handlers behind the original Ghostbusters film that could uplift the disjointed high jinks and synthetic silliness of Feig\'s current comedic ghostly she-power schlockfest.\nIt is only natural that Ghostbusters had high expectations for Sony Pictures to perform well given the aggressive marketing tactics, early release of the Ghostbusters movie trailer (which was heavily panned online) and the aforementioned cinematic legacy of the original film\'s fanatical following and reputation. However, this third installation of Ghostbusters feels curiously flat and strained in its stillborn witticism. The creep factor borders on campy and cheesy (although this effectively worked for Ivan Reitman\'s 32-year old spook-ridden farce in the eighties) for which in today\'s cinematic circle is inexcusable due to the edgier and challenging special effects that could have played up the whimsy and wonderment of this breezy, bubble-gum colored romp with seemingly low-grade spark and sizzle.\nFeig\'s interpretation of the Ghostbusters universe could have been fresh and favorable especially with the colorful casting of his capable four female principals in the Emmy-winning and Oscar-nominated Melissa McCarthy along with Saturday Night Live personalities Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones. Unfortunately for these noted funny ladies they were saddled (or slimmed if you will) by a transparent script almost as invisible as the pesky ghosts they are trying to pacify. The recycled by-the-numbers hilarity and hysteria does not make this brand of ghost-busting quite distinguishing. Chemistry-wise, the Ghostbuster gals seem to revel in the collective merry-minded mischievousness and genuinely try to bring energy and outrageous antics to this flaccid frightfest. Still, the mixture of Ghostbusters\' gooey gumption with a dash of egghead feisty femininity never seems to translate into anything beyond the tired gimmick of promoting another excuse to tap into yesteryear\'s profitable fun and frolic that made the wise-cracking Murray and his klutzy cohorts so amusing and welcomed in their rollicking ghostly gem from the Reagan-era.\nQuite frankly the notion that Ghostbusters is unfairly being knocked for its misogynistic overtones fueled by bias Internet-based fanboys not accepting that nerdy womanly scientists cannot fill the shoes of their revered male counterparts from the previous two predecessors is somewhat misleading. Sure, the decision to cast an all-female Ghostbusters team turned some curious heads but for the most part many thought this to be rather intriguing and experimental. The actual disdain can be pinpointed to the fact that Feig\'s flimsy boo-spewing fable is grounded in cliched and forced chuckles, weak-kneed jokes and gags, lazy writing and uninspired visual neon lighting techniques that look like a cheapened explosion from a vintage late 70\'s New York discotheque.\nUnfortunately, Ghostbusters wallows in mediocrity and fails to capture the acquired giddiness and imagination so pronounced in the prior entertaining installments. Even if the original actors in Murray, Aykroyd, the late Ramis and Hudson had decided to reprise their roles under Feig\'s problematic production the results would be the same--an aimless reboot without any definitive bite or backbone for a cobbled comedy that is slight and stretched thin to its toothless core. Amazingly, Ghostbusters cannot decide if it should remain faithful to its humble roots (it does help trivially that iconic Ghostbuster notables make scattered cameos--sans Rick Moranis--including that glorified scene-stealer in the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man as well as hot dog gulper Slimer) or venture off into something resembling its own goofy identity and distinction. Either way the third time around simply meanders in over-produced, noisy emptiness.\nThe so-called plot in Ghostbusters focuses on college professor Erin Gilbert (Wiig presumably in the Murray/Dr. Peter Venkman role) and her fascination with ghost activities that end up costing her an academic career in the process. Specifically, Erin\'s controversial book that she wrote along with co-author Abby Yates (McCarthy) served as the basis for her firing. Abby\'s obsession with ghosts still has her invested with this spirit phenomenon that she researches defiantly with her kooky associate Jillian Holtzman (McKinnon) in tow. Eventually, it would take the trio\'s status of joblessness (not to mention a run-in with a slim-spewing ghost that loves soaking humans with its sticky green goo) to collaborate on going into business as paranormal exterminators out to showcase their expertise in ""busting ghosts"".\nIn the meanwhile, there is something brewing in the twisted mind of supernatural-loving freak Rowan North (Neil Casey). After all, he is the lost soul responsible for unleashing the onslaught of riff-raffish apparitions upon New York City courtesy of his miserable, lonely existence. Now it is up to Erin, Abby and Jillian to eliminate Rowan\'s sinister agenda and eradicate the spooky pests that he has manipulated to cause the city-wide panic. As Internet sensational darlings, the Ghostbusters are committed to step up to the plate as the sassy saviors they were meant to be since going into the ghost-busting industry.\nThe later arrival of street-wise transit worker Patty Tolan (Jones) completes the Ghostbusters\' quartet. Patty, whose run in with one of the slimy ghosts in the subway tunnel was pivotal to joining the three scientists, has something to offer the ghost-chasing brainiacs--a.) her knowledge of the city\'s whereabouts and b.) her funeral director uncle\'s hearse that serves as the official transportation for the Ghostbusters.\nOverall, the third outing regarding this toothless entry Ghostbusters notoriously lacks the robust impishness and rapport of the male character counterparts that were devilishly drawn together and cemented by Murray\'s droll humor. Here, the ladies come off as bland and indifferent--at least for the Paul McCartney and John Lennon of the team in Wiig\'s Erin Gilbert and McCarthy\'s Abby Yates. McKinnon\'s Jillian Holtzman is the only truly spry Ghostbuster who is credible as an off-kilter genius ditz with off-the-wall likability. Some may gravitate towards Jones\'s stereotypical brassy black chick with the brash quips and animated overreactions. Although Jones brings in the high-wire urbanized smirks in contrast to her quieter, geekier counterparts it is cringe-worthy watching her play an over-the-top, towering, mouthy cultural exaggeration that is woefully embarrassing for the sake of this dismissive. hedonistic hoot.\nIronically it is the hunky Chris Hemsworth that fares decently as the handsome himbo Kevin, the dim-witted Ghostbusters\' male assistant that serves as the doltish eye candy for the cerebral lasses, particularly for the smitten Erin.

Don't waste your time.""], ['60%', 'As a child, I remember catching David Lynch’s “Dune” on TV. I was too young to really understand the plot at the time, but I didn’t care, all I knew was that the worms were awesome. When I got a little older, I read the book for my first time. It was the first “adult” book I read on my own, and I was in love with it ever since. I read it many more times growing up, and when the miniseries came out, I watched and recorded it every night, then re-watched it time and time again. When “Children of Dune” aired, I again devoured it happily. In the case of the Lynch film, as I grew, I of course began to see more and more of the flaws, though I personally hold the “Spicediver Edit” in quite high esteem. That particular cut of the film manages to make the Lynch version into what is a genuinely good film, but still imperfect. The miniseries has, up until now, remained my preferred adaptation. Now we have a new adaptation: Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune”, and it certainly is quite different from the previous two versions in many ways, but is it good? Well, at least from my perspective, that answer is complicated. The short version is yes, it is a good film, but it’s not a great one.\n\nThe gist of the story is straightforward. Many, many millennia in the future, Paul, the son of the Duke Leto Atreides, finds himself and his family caught in plots of intrigue, and betrayal, after taking custody of a new and valuable planet. In order to survive, he finds that he will have to depend on the training of his mother, the Lady Jessica, the help of the planets local population, the fremen, and his growing awareness of a great, yet possibly terrible destiny that waits for him. \n\nIn reality though, the story is anything but. The novel is infamous for being “unadaptable” with its complex “plots within plots” storyline, along with its sheer size. There is simply too much going on in the story to make it easy to turn into a film, or even a series. The previous efforts have all brought different aspects of the novel to the forefront, and this new version is no different. In broad strokes, it is perhaps the most faithful to the novel in terms of themes, and it certainly emphasizes some aspects of the political commentary behind the novel, such as the missionaria protectiva, which was nowhere to be found in the Lynch film, and only really hinted at in the miniseries. They also spend a little more time focusing on the fremen and their sentiments toward off-worlders after living under the Harkonnen regime, but unfortunately, while it is nice to see these themes in the film, they are undercut by little development. In fact, the entire film suffers on that front. So much of the political context and scheming has been left out that the film as presented feels somehow empty. \n\nEarly in the film, it is established that the emperor considers the Duke Leto a threat due to his popularity, but never really explores too much beyond it. Even more strangely, the film establishes this, but then later makes it seem like they were never really certain about the fact that the emperor was involved in a key scene, unlike the book, where the Duke was fully aware that they were heading into a trap, and was attempting to outmaneuver his political opponents. The Baron Harkonnen is limited to a few admittedly atmospheric scenes where he more or less confirms the emperor is aiding him in their goal to destroy the Atreides line, but it is reduced to a few scant lines, the bare minimum necessary to understand the plot. This, unfortunately results in very shallow characterization, and the same problem runs throughout the film. Gurney Halleck, Thufir Hawat, and Doctor Yueh are all present, but each of them is only given a small handful of scenes, in which they only speak a few lines each, before they are forgotten to focus on Paul, or beautiful scenic shots. They never feel like fully realized characters in the film, more as brief supporting roles, whom are only present in order to fulfill their roles in the larger storyline. Thufir Hawat receives perhaps the worst treatment in this regard. Even the primary cast are not given a lot of development. We are given enough to know who they are, and a little of their personality, but nothing more. It seems strange, that the longest adaptation of the first half of the novel ever made should have less detail and character than either previous version. It does however, and it certainly hurts the film as a result. Long, moody shots are great, but only when they exist in addition with actual depth. The plot of the film has been streamlined to the point that it feels watered-down, and genuinely wastes the talents of its cast all stuck in roles that have been similarly effected. \n\nThere are also a few key scenes that actively go against things covered in the book. One scene features the Lady Jessica speaking of secretive matters regarding the bene gesserit sisterhood while sitting in the cockpit of an ornithopter right behind Thufir Hawat, whom would be easily able to hear everything she had just said. Another moment, involves the Reverend Mother Mohiam referring to Jessica as Leto’s “wife”, even though she would know full well that they aren’t married. Yet another moment involves that Shadout Mapes pulling out a crysknife to offer it to Jessica while out in the open, and Jessica is in the presence of guards. The Shadout later sheathes the knife unblooded, and those who have read the book will know why that choice does not work for the film, especially in the context of fremen later being shown cutting themselves before sheathing their knives. Of course, in any adaptation there will be liberties taken, and there are indeed more, but these three moments in particular certainly seem to stand out the most in regards to actively going against aspects of the original novel, and in doing so, hurt this film as an adaptation.\n\nWith that said, there were things I liked as well. As I have stated a number of times, the film is gorgeous. There are a couple of scenes that certainly seemed to be more “style over substances”, such as a shot of ships rising from the ocean for… no apparent reason, but man do they look beautiful. There is also a very real sense of scale in the film that I can freely admit neither previous version ever accomplished. As a result, there are a few scenes that do far better match their description in the book, and are glorious to watch.\n\nI do really appreciate the way they portray the emperor, discussed, but never seen. A powerful force that can be felt looming in the background, his hand guiding everything happening. He is built up excellently, and I will be curious to see how well he is portrayed if we get a sequel. In the previous adaptations, he was prominently displayed and used to provide greater context for the politics of the story, but in the book, he is only ever seen in the end, and keeping book accurate in this case certainly works very well.\n\nThe film also features the most book accurate version of Paul’s growing prescience, hinting at possible outcomes rather than complete premonitions. The way it is executed is not necessarily without its flaws, or heavy-handedness in a couple of moments, but it works well. Similarly, we also get the story of the bull and Leto’s father for the first time, though the film attempts to make the bull symbolic in a manner I am not sure really works, or is earned.\u3000Also notable is the death of a significant character finally matching their death in the novel. \n\nI have also stated that the cast does a great job, and I stand by that. In the entire film, there is not a bad performance in the film. My only complaint would be with the portrayal of the Lady Jessica, who comes across as too emotional, presumably in an attempt to show her ability to shift from being upset to being entirely refined and composed in moments, but that is a matter of writing rather than performance. When it comes to the casting, I personally felt that many of the actors matched their roles well, in particular enjoying the casting of Duke Leto and the Baron. I did not however care much for the gender-swapping of Liet, which served no real purpose, especially when one considers how small the characters role was in this version of the film, though Sharon Duncan-Brewster did a good job with what she had. I also did not care for the casting of Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica. While she is a very good actress, she seemed to me a bit too “girl next door”, rather than the character from the novel that the Duke Leto notes “reintroduced regality into the Atreides line”. \n\nWhen it comes to the score, I will admit that I was not certain how I would feel in regards to Hans Zimmer’s work on the film. The samples I had heard up until this point had been interesting, but I was not sure how it would work in terms of the film itself. I can say that it works well, though there are moments when it feels almost as watered-down as the plot itself. It never really allowed me to feel excited at any point, but it did match the tone of the film very well, and I can easily see myself turning it on whenever I clean my house in order to set a “mood” (Ha! See what I did there?). \n\nIn conclusion, despite my criticisms, I did enjoy the film. I think it works well enough to be understood, though there may be some moments where the average viewer could find themselves feeling confused. It certainly is a visual spectacle, but one undercut by excessive trimming of detail and world-building. I hope it is successful enough to warrant a sequel in order to finish the story, but I also find that I will not be upset if it does not. As adaptations go, this is no “The Lord of the Rings”. In the end, I have to rate this version of “Dune” closer to the original Lynch film, and maintain the miniseries as my favorite adaptation of an amazing novel.'], ['-', 'Great movie with excellent BG music and visual effects.

In fact, I think he's a hack whose only genuine talent is making stupid people falsely think they are actually quite smart. I am also a HUGE Dune fan. They have been my favourite series of books since I first discovered them as a teenager. So although I hoped for the best with this, I was expecting the worst. What I got was somewhere in the middle. It's an OK movie, not great, thankfully not terrible, but OK\nIt got some things right the 1984 Lynch version got wrong, but still somehow managed to get other stuff wrong (including stuff Lynch got right). It was also a surprise how much Villeneuve just lifted directly from the Lynch film, both visually and auditorily.\nThe wardrobe choices were a huge disappointment. If you didn't know the time setting, going just on the clothes in the new Dune you'd be forgiven for thinking it was set a mere forty or fifty years (if that) in the future rather than the twenty thousand years in the future when it's really set. The Lynch stillsuits look futuristic, unworldly, and something that really would keep you alive in the deep desert. The new desert wear looks like they are just going to go dirt biking for an hour or two in our present-day world.\nThe casting (completely ignoring the pointless gender swap) was good, However, with the exception of Paul, Chani, and Rabban the original casting was all better. But the original (apart from the odd decision to use the totally unsuited Kyle MacLachlan) was a masterclass in how to cast the perfect people for the role.\nAnyway, enough of the comparisons, This film is about the first two-thirds of the first novel. I always thought the story would be better told via a big-budget TV series (or even mini-series) rather than a standalone movie. I still think what they tried to cover here was too much for a single movie, but it was a step in the right direction.\nThe film mainly sticks to the book story but does make some needless changes, the most obvious of which being the changes made to both the gender and story of Liet Kynes, which in turn impacts the story of Chani. Most other changes are small and mainly insignificant though.\nThe film being filmed in Norway, Jordan, and Abu Dhabi looks fantastic and very well suited to the large screen. And it's clear a great deal of time, effort, and money was put into the sets that looked equally good as the places they were meant to be.\nThe acting was of a suitably high standard, but unfortunately, many of the Dune names and terms were horribly mispronounced. That and the Hans Zimmer fart that is played constantly throughout the soundtrack is likely to pull people out of their emersion in the movie.\nI was also somewhat surprised by what was left out, OK the source material is VERY dense and obviously some needed to be cut, but I don't really think it's made clear just how crucial melange is to the functioning of the empire and society as a whole. Also what (and why) mentats are is largely ignored, you may think that isn't overly important, but it is at the core of how many things are done in the Dune universe.\nOver all, it's not a bad movie.

I\'m going to talk about both of them here.\nThis may not be a popular opinion: Lynch\'s version is brilliant and the Villeneuve Dune is absolute shit. Here\'s why:\nFirst, is the Villeneuve Dune slick? Yes, absolutely. I should hope so considering it\'s nearly 40 years after Lynch did his, for crissake.\nAre the character\'s in David Lynch\'s version kitschy and over the top? Yes! That\'s one reason it\'s so much better! It\'s Sci Fi, duh! You watch Marvel movies and suspend disbelief for incredible, imaginary super powers? All of Lynch\'s characters are downright gritty and believable within this particular surreal fantasy.\nBy the end of the Lynch Dune, I had sympathy for nearly every character in the film. Even the villains caught my emotions. Paul Atreides character development was realistic and attractive.\nVilleneuve\'s characters? I felt like my neighbor came over and asked, ""Hey, can you come to watch my kid\'s junior high school play?"" ""Sure, Denis, just let me fill my 1-liter flask with tequila first.""\nVilleneuve\'s characters were so damned flat and lifeless that they evoked NO emotional response whatsoever. Although I occasionally sit through a bad flick, I can\'t remember recently watching a movie as awful character-wise, as the 2021 Dune. If I were an actor on that set, I would be silently screaming. How does a director even do this?\nOh, and where\'s the creativity? It\'s 46 years since George Lucas founded Industrial Light & Magic, and Denis can\'t create one single, new, goddamn space machine 46 years later? (One could argue the hummingbird copter is new, but it\'s not so creative when you realize that we didn\'t even know how hummingbird wings actually worked until this millennia.)\nBut here\'s the real clincher: the screenplay. David Lynch gave us a complete story. Sadly, he didn\'t have the final cut and disowned his film when the critics panned it. Despite the fact that Lynch is a true artist and genius, the studio took 45 minutes out of the film. 45 minutes! Even ruined by the studio, even 40 years later, Lynch\'s film has a clear vision and carries the timeless message that Frank Herbert intended. I would LOVE to see the original cut!\nVilleneuve, on the other hand, stopped abruptly in the middle of the book. I now realize that Denis is not about the story. Denis is all about the franchise money, and that sucks. As a result of the bad screenplay, this 2021 version doesn\'t even carry the socio-political statement it was supposed to have.

This is a difficult movie to make special effects for since this universe is a weird mix between futuristic science fiction, fantasy elements and old-fashioned traditions.\nI have to say that they succeeded quite well though. The atmosphere felt just right, ships, spice harvesters, buildings looked cool and fitting the story. The way they implemented the personal shields was very nice. They didn’t go overboard on special effects and weird designs. The ornithopter was of course totally ridiculous from a scientific point of view but at least it looked pretty cool.\nIf I should complain about something, although that is not the fault of the movie but of the source material, I have never understood how, in a universe which is obviously driven by hidden agendas, machinations and assassinations, the Atreides could just pick up everything, leave their home and put all their important eggs in one basket at Arrakis.\nOne more small thing that I could complain about would of course be that we now have to wait two years, from what I have read, until we get to watch the next movie to get to the part were the really cool stuff happens.\nBottom line, this was movie is definitely in there vying for the title “best movie that I have watched this year”.']]"

It showcased the world of the Amazon warriors. It was unique in the often cookie-cutter super hero origin stories. Patty Jenkins did a good job of framing it, but I think the character\'s origin story dating back to the comics has always been unique in comparison to other super heroes.\nThe result is that the first third or so of the movie is satisfying--despite dull performances from Gal Gadot and Chris Pine (who had zero chemistry as a couple). But once we leave the confines of the island and enter the real world, the movie becomes hit or miss. WWI (that\'s right, WWI now, not WWII.

But DC\'s version of Captain America\'s Howling Commandos consist of an Arab and an American Indian. Diversity for diversity\'s sake becomes distracting--especially when paired with a low-rent Simon Pegg whose soul function is being a deadly sniper who never fires his weapon (that\'s helpful on a top-secret mission behind enemy lines).\nIt\'s almost as if the movie telegraphs all of these unnecessary plot hiccups to remind you that this is a super hero film, and no matter how much the mortal humans fail, it will all be okay because the super hero will save the day.\nThe dialogue can be clichéd at times, and the final theme of the movie--one of love conquering all and the acknowledgement that, overall, mankind is good, is laughable in it\'s amateur preachiness.\nBut what the film lacks in substance and script, it makes up for in the visuals. I found the action sequences to be great fun. Heavily stylized ""Matrix-style"" fight scenes seem right at home in a film about super hero Gods. The freeze frames worked too--as fight sequences froze in over-the-top super hero poses that harkened back to the source material\'s comic book roots.\nThe final confrontation between Wonder Woman and Ares--while dragging on a little long--was well done, being one of the few super hero movie climaxes that delivered.\nWhile aspects of the movie were so similar (Hell! Identical!) to Captain America: The First Avenger, I actually felt embarrassed for the filmmakers, I did come away thinking this was the movie Captain America should have been. It succeeded in places where Captain America failed miserably.\nThe movie is entertainment--pure, fun, pop-corn-gobbling entertainment. In that realm, it succeeds and succeeds well. But as a piece of cinematic art, it falls flat on its face with too many plot holes, script inconsistencies, clichés and mediocre acting.

This is definitely a movie that you watch for the sake of the special effects. Well, if you are a male teenager you might also be watching it to drool over Gal Gadot of course (I have to admit that she is hot).\nThere is not too much to say about the plot. Our Amazon hot chick discovers that there is a war going on and goes out to stop it. Since she has been overly protected by her guardian she is amazingly clueless about life outside of her little island. Especially aspects involving men. Something which creates some funny moments as well as some embarrassingly silly ones. This, Diana’s gradual evolution where she not only is learning about life but also discovers her considerable powers, is one of the enjoyable aspects of the movie though. It is of course also one of the dummer aspects of the movie. How the f… could the Amazon Queen race Diana to be so ignorant about everything?\nAnother not so enjoyable part of the movie is the ludicrous scenes where the britts are trying to obtain peace at all costs as well as the stereotypical portrayal of Ludendorff as some megalomaniacal, half crazy war-mongerer. This was just dumb. I guess Zac Snyder just picked the name out of some history book without bothering to read up on the character. Typical lack of intelligence and respect, a la Hollywood, for anything outside of their, very limited, sphere of knowledge.\nWell, at least Danny Huston did a pretty decent job of the shitty role he was given. So did most of the rest of actors. I definitely liked Gal Gadot as Super Woman but then, although I am not a teenager, I am still a male so maybe I am biased when it comes to her?\nI definitely liked the special effects. The showdown at the end was great as far as I am concerned and the rest not bad either. They could have been even better though if it would not have been so obvious that the Germans where mostly incompetent extras waiting for Wonder Woman to show off her gymnastics and slow motion abilities. Come on, even superhero special effects should make some pretense of being “realistic” superhero special effects.\nThe movie is definitely aimed at the young adult segment. Unfortunately it do not seem to know what it is aiming for. Sometimes it is almost adult, sometimes it is late teen and sometimes just so bloody TV-show silly that you’re wondering if it is aiming for even pre-teens.\nAnyway, regardless of its faults I did enjoy my 2+ hour spent on this movie.

Desperate to save his dad from the chair and and to reincarnate mom, he decides to use his great speed to take on time itself! Despite being warned against this potentially reckless action by ""Batman"" (the most fleeting of appearances from Ben Affleck) he goes for it; gets knocked out of the timeline and finds himself face to face with - himself (only much better looking with wavy hair). This isn\'t the only thing that\'s changing on the old space-time continuum and shortly after, ""General Zod"" (Michael Shannon) arrives bent on avenging the destruction of his home world of ""Krypton"" on the people of Earth.

They are clearly enjoying this, and there is loads of charisma emanating from both performances from a star who bucks the normal trend of being handsome but rather wooden. Miller is the former, certainly, but they bring life to the role. It\'s fun, and abetted by a story that has some weight and plenty of pace to it, we are taken on a series of lightly comedic adventures that make 2 hours and 20 minutes quite literally whizz by. Sasha Calle gives us some diversion from the Ezra show as Superman\'s cousin - no slouch in a fight either, and Keaton does fine as he rehabilitates his disillusioned ""Batman"" character using his gadgets and gizmos to great effect. It\'s so much better than I was expecting and I have to say that I enjoyed the quirkiness of Miller\'s interpretation of ""Barry"" - nowhere near as sterile and simpering as Grant Gustin\'s pure as the driven snow portrayal. The multiverse can keep on inventing and reinventing scenarios and the visual effects can work wonders making just about anything possible - but without strong and personable characters then I am sure I will just bore of the relentless repetition of these stories. Miller is different.

Throughout all the problems, the most incomprehensible is certainly how Warner kept allowing such a person as Ezra Miller to be cast as the main role to be the face of a hero. With a budget of $200 million they were able to deliver the worst possible CGI ever seen, and with it a crumbled plot that wishes for more of everything but Flash.\nMichael Keaton has done a brilliant performance within this movie as a throwback to the 89\'s Batman. And with it, the new addition to the Justice League, Sasha Calle has done a fantastic job as Supergirl (Kara Zor-El), but both get rushed plot points that makes the audience wish for more of their screen time or even a solo movie and not the teenage nuisance that Barry Allen is. One minute, Supergirl rushes out ignoring everything, the other she\'s at the door regretting her decision and trying to help the rest of the characters. The same can be said about Michael Keaton\'s character.\nThe movie dives into the concept of time and its dangerous potential, later forgetting everything about it and labeling it ""multiverse"" instead, following Marvel\'s recent movies like Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Spider-Man: No Way Home and not adding a single spark of creativity with it. But those movies at least have decent scores, the music within this one must have been selected from a random kid\'s playlist...\nThe movie is also 2h 24m long, being completely unnecessary. Various scenes are completly descartable, an action scene at the start was put there with no thought whatsoever and is 15m of wasted narrative that could be used to invest in Supergirl\'s story (if she is here to stay). Iris West has no reason to be put into the movie. And for some reason they decided to make a bunch of cameos using CGI, and as previously said, that didn\'t go well.\nIn the end, DC is still the same mess. They can\'t properly build a plot and create a movie that sustains its own beliefs. Ben Affleck\'s Batman, at the start, said we can\'t change our past due to the fact that those key moments that leave scars are the moments that build our foundation and make us who we are.

To my mind, the foremost is the lead character. The Flash\'s over cooked dripiness, unfunny, goofy antics and fall flat humour, can\'t quite ""sell"" the concept of him as a hero. If the films producers and writers, wanted to know how to develop a more accessible lead character, they should have looked at the series. It does a much better job at balancing the characters innate nerdiness, with his other, more heroic, qualities.\nThe second point of failure is essentially re-inventing elements of the story from the series and past films. Flash fans who have watched the series, may well find the film adaptation somewhat repetitive and predictable. Equally recycling large swatches of past films, with tweaks here and there, isn\'t doing anything that ""new"" either.\nPerhaps the only real point of interest is utilising a range of past actors and characters, from the franchise, such as Batman, Superman/woman and Wonder Woman.\nIn summary, not an awful film but still a little unoriginal.

By placing an emphasis on the smarter and more emotional side of the story rather than the visual spectacle, the movie is thematically much richer than the customary loud and dumb summer popcorn flicks to which audiences are well-accustomed.\nIn this DC Extended Universe (DCEU) installment, worlds collide when Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) uses his superpowers to travel back in time with the goal of preventing a tragic event in the past. His attempt to change the timeline has consequences, as he alters the future and creates a reality where there’s no Superman (Sasha Calle‘s introduction as Supergirl is fun, but feels rushed) or Aquaman, Batman (Michael Keaton) is retired, and General Zod (Michael Shannon) has returned and is threatening to annihilate the universe. Without the help of his fellow heroes, Barry must use his wits to save the world and reset the timetable before it’s too late.\nThe story goes to a place that that will make every superhero fan groan: the multiverse. Don’t panic, though, co-writers Christina Hodson and Joby Harold have actually put care thoughtful care into their clever narrative, and the idea of different timelines and realities not only make sense, they aren’t wholly ridiculous or irritating. In similar films that head into the multiverse, it more often than not feels like a lazy cop-out where every death or shocking revelation can later be explained away by shouting, “Gotcha! It was only time manipulation.” Here, there are real consequences in situations where the stakes are extremely high.\nBarry partnering with an alternate version of himself is a lot of fun, as is meeting DC heroes old and new. There are a lot of amusing cameos that will make fans very happy. The core of the story is a classic one, giving Barry a real motivation to go back in time to alter the past. The thought of being able to change our present by finding the ability to prevent tragedy, right wrongs, and save the people we love is one that is universal, and it works well here.\nWhile the story is engaging, the visual effects are abysmal. The CGI is cartoonish and dark, with inarticulate motion and a dreary palette of dark grays and blues. It’s a terrible looking movie, something that is amplified during the poorly executed action sequences. Things that sound good on paper end up feeling lame, including a silly intro scene of a hospital that’s raining babies. The fight choreography and stunt work is so much better than the computer animated bits.\nMy favorite element of the movie is Miller’s lead performance. He’s tasked with playing an alternate version of himself, sharing the screen with a younger Barry for much of the movie. This isn’t an easy thing to do, and Miller excels at it. This is one of his best performances, and one that plays perfectly into his endearing awkwardness and bumbling charm. Despite Miller’s disturbing string of personal scandals, you’ll find he’s the best thing about the film (if you have the ability to separate the art from the artist).\nI never expected to be so emotionally invested in a summer superhero movie about a character I care so little about, but “The Flash” has a sweet and touching story that’s combined with a lot of fun surprises, bursts of corny nostalgia, and a bevy of cameos that will result in audience cheers and applause. Strangely enough, it’s one of the best film in the DCEU canon.\nBy: Louisa Moore'], ['70%', ""There's some good stuff here and of course a good chunk was reminders of my childhood and fandome of Batman '89 and seeing Michael Keaton back in the role.

It did touch me emotionally due to my personal issues going on right now.\nThat said, this didn't completely work due to, let's say, inconsistencies in quality of the previous DCEU movies, most of them I did like but can acknowledge how the studio, in its various iterations, bungled it. And in regards to to Ezra Miller, one has to separate the artist from the art which given how much of a creep he is, is difficult to do when humor is one of the keys for the character.\nAll in all, it was a satisfying and entertaining movie but considering that James Gunn is pretty much rebooting for a new DCU, it doesn't matter very much and I don't see myself watching again anytime soon. 3.5/5""]]"

See ""Weird Barbie"" (Emerald Fennell) and seek her sagely advice. That, however, she doesn\'t like. She must enter into the real world and find whoever is supposed to be playing with her - clearly not an happy girl - and see if she can cheer her up and restore the equilibrium. En route, she finds that her ever devoted ""Ken"" will join her and their arrival in the big city introduces both to a bewildering world of sexists, misogynists and cynics.

What’s more, much of the dialogue is either stupefyingly juvenile or sounds more like “writing” than anything anyone would actually say (even for a fictional fantasy character), with attempts at humor that often fall woefully flat. And, to be honest, for all intents and purposes, the project comes across like a two-hour commercial for Mattel (even if the company manages to find ways to poke fun at itself).

It's one of those films that has already gone beyond cinematic issues to become a piece of art and culture that we all know, even people who never took the time to see it.\nThus, it is not worth wasting time explaining the plot around the “Nostromo”, a cargo ship with seven crew members who are decimated by a highly dangerous and carnivorous alien. The direction, in charge of Ridley Scott, is excellent, meticulous, attentive, and the story is intelligent, very well written and with well-developed and used characters.

The visual spectacle and attention to detail were captivating, and I found myself marveling at the creativity on screen. The vibrant colors and imaginative set designs truly brought the beloved story to life.\nWhat sets Wonka apart is its ability to strike a perfect balance between nostalgia for those familiar with the classic tale and a fresh, modern twist that keeps the storyline engaging.

It has such incredible potential. The imagined prequel is consistent with Ronald Dahl's charm and wit. Timothee Chalamet’s performance was sensational. The supporting cast including Keegan Michael Keye, Patterson Joseph, Hugh Grant, Olivia Coleman and Jim Carter were all at their best.\nThe film falls short with the casting director's (Nina Gold's) attempt to find new talent in a novice actress named Calah Lane who stars in the movie opposite Timothee Chalamet as the character known as Noodle. The character itself is drawn well but the performance is so dreadful by Lane that it single-handedly destroys what could and should have been a classic prequel to Dahls original masterpiece. Lane throws out all her lines without any emotion and spends no time listening to her supporting cast. The writing becomes meaningless and almost immediately you do not find yourself caring about the Noodle character at all. This becomes quickly distracting to any audience member who has an inclination to invest in the story or other characters in the movie. The film completely dies and falls short on this one performance because the character of Noodle is drawn in such a way that her present and future well-being is central to the strength of the story's momentum.\nOne has to blame the casting director Nina Gold first. Nina Gold's work on projects like Bad Sisters, Game of Thrones and The Crown has been quite exceptional but in terms of finding new talent for this prospective cinema masterpiece just is not consistent with her previous achievements. I would also say that the failure of this film should also fall on Director Paul King's shoulders who also needs to bare the burden of this complete and utter disaster of a decision to put poor Calah Lane in this role and have all of us suffer this miserable performance and ultimately crushing blow to Roald Dahl's reputation as a storyteller and great wit.""], ['80%', 'After so many years I wonder if the majority of people have seen the original (comedy / musical) movie of 71, that is a classic.

I mean, how couldn\'t it be?! Besides belonging to the superhero genre, DC has been on a streak of great films within its universe, so an isolated installment definitely excites me, especially about one of the evilest villains ever. It\'s by far one of the less comic-book-y flicks of the century. It doesn\'t follow the generic origin story formula, it avoids any cliches associated with the genre, and it\'s the type of movie that\'s becoming more and more rare nowadays. It\'s a character study like we haven\'t seen in a long time.\nI\'ll simply begin with the person that elevates the entire thing: Joaquin Phoenix. Now, if there\'s something I\'m not going to do is compare his performance with Heath Ledger\'s. That\'s the number one mistake people are going to keep making forever. First of all, The Dark Knight and Joker couldn\'t be more distinct films, even if they belong to the same genre (despite Joker being unique, it\'s still about a famous comic-book villain). Then, despite Phoenix and Ledger portraying the same ""version"" of the clown (crazy, sadistic psychopath), the former is 90% Arthur Fleck while the latter is 100% Joker, throughout each of their movies. Finally, Phoenix is the sole protagonist of this feature, while Ledger had the best live-action Batman sharing the spotlight.\nIn conclusion, it\'s both unfair, and a bit unreasonable to compare both interpretations since their roles have a different impact on the narrative, as well as each film being entirely different. In the end, both are impressive. However, let\'s switch to Phoenix since he\'s the star of this show … He has 2019\'s best performance, by far! With a strong marketing campaign, I\'m sure he\'ll get that Oscar. I hope so! It\'s so well-deserved. Todd Phillips and Scott Silver developed a brilliant screenplay, but Phoenix elevates it to a whole other level.\nThroughout the entire runtime, I felt weird. Perturbed. Even uncomfortable with what I was watching and consequently feeling. It\'s a dark, brutal, violent, emotionally powerful origin of a villain who I feel disturbingly empathetic towards. Phoenix makes the story work due to its remarkably captivating display of someone who\'s mentally ill. Arthur Fleck slowly becoming crazier is due to how society behaves and not due to some chemical pool that transforms his skin white and hair green (nothing wrong with this, but I know which origin story I prefer). ""The world is getting crazier out there"", and it becomes excruciatingly painful to deal with it, especially when so much is going on with Arthur’s personal life, and most of it he doesn\'t even realize because he tries to hide everything behind a smile.\nIt\'s a screenplay filled with narrative twists that not only pack a punch of surprise but leave you feeling extremely upset. The last act is one of the best in the last few years. If the second act is an enormous build-up, the last one is a terrific payoff. I can\'t remember the last movie I saw where I loved 100% every single narrative decision. I wouldn\'t do any of the big moments differently. There are so many excellent references hidden in plain sight that comic-book fans (and fans of the TDK trilogy as well) will love just like I did. In the ending, there\'s one pivotal moment in particular that serves as the absolute climax … I got chills all over my body. They couldn\'t have done that scene more perfect. I only have one tiny nitpick with the way some scenes feel repetitive since they neither move the plot forward or give us anything new. Some of these still help to create tension, some feel like they\'re just… there.\nA Best Picture and Best Actor nominations seem to be on its way, but these are not the only achievements that deserve to be recognized. The original score by Hildur Guðnadóttir is incredibly addictive, so much that I\'m listening to it while writing this review. It definitely helps to generate tremendous build-up, and it elevates the sinister environment of Gotham City. Lawrence Sher\'s cinematography is utterly stunning. The underexposure of some scenes is glorious. Sher paints the screen with so many gorgeous shots, especially with his close-ups on Phoenix, where the latter is able to shine. Jeff Groth is also impeccable in the editing room. There are several long takes with Phoenix just giving his all and letting all his emotions out (or keeping them all contained), which is always something I deeply appreciate since it helps with the flow of the narrative.\nRegarding the film\'s controversy surrounding its messages and the incentive to violence, I really don\'t know what to say. It\'s ridiculous. I remember those times when going into the movie theater was a surreal experience. It was the number one place for people to forget about their lives, jobs, everything. Joker is a fictional story! It\'s the origin of one of the worst psychopaths in the history of comic-books and cinema. If people expected to leave the theater ""happy"" or ""joyful"", then at least one of the film\'s message is right: society really is getting crazier. Have people forgotten who Joker is? What could you possibly expect from his origin story?!\nNowadays, no one knows how to behave (social media is the primary source for spreading hate). No one respects the fellow citizen or even the world itself. More and more people only look at their own bellies. Political agendas are everywhere. New extreme movements are created every other year. Social hypersensibility is exponentially growing. The same way some people will hate this movie for not being able (or simply not wanting) to accept that they feel empathy towards a murderer, people all around the world behave like their actions don\'t reflect on another person\'s life and on their own planet. If people get ruthlessly violent because they watched Joker, how can someone complain that the film\'s message is bad when it\'s eventually true?\nAll in all, Joker is one of the best movies of the year, and it\'s definitely on my Top3 at the date of this review. Joaquin Phoenix delivers my favorite male performance of 2019, by elevating a script about the origin of one of the evilest villains ever. The way he gradually becomes more insane is worthy of study, but it\'s how he\'s able to make the audience create empathy towards a psychopath that leaves me disturbingly captivated. Todd Phillips produces a character-study filled with an astonishingly tense build-up and one of the most chill-inducing payoffs of the last few years. With every single narrative decision nailed perfectly, Hildur Guðnadóttir\'s score and Lawrence Sher\'s cinematography stand out. The lack of restraint in showing the unmerciful violence (physical and mental) that society inflicts on one another is what makes us feel unsettled. Because we know it\'s mostly true, and we refuse to accept it. It\'s not a film about the Joker. It\'s a very realistic portrayal of someone (anyone!) who can become someone like him. And it\'s disturbingly brilliant!\nPS: Robert DeNiro (Murray Franklin) and Zazie Beetz (Sophie Dumond) are also great. Phoenix\'s performance is so mesmerizing that I almost forgot there were other actors in the movie.\nRating: A'], ['-', ""Joker. The character that has existed since 1940, has become so heavy with so many different portrayals, different origins, that it feels impossible for any mortal man alive to impersonate the scattered personalities. It is an insurmountable task for any director to digest it all and still produce one more.\nTodd Phillips had a crazy challenge. He brought in one of the best actors alive to lift it with him, Joaquin Phoenix. Together, they have built a mass-market masterpiece which is just above the crop. It is appropriately crazy and completely focussed on the central character. The narrator goes close to the shores of that craziness, wets his feet but remains dry to tell this story. It is like those news reporters which go closer to the burning amazon, but it is impossible to step in the fumes. In no way, Joker is telling his story. Instead, his story is told to us and there are pillars of sanity (like the detectives, asylum clerk etc.) which remain steadfast to give a strong anchor to the audience. This dilutes the effect of the film.\nWith the copious amount of material on Joker already, I wished to consider this film as a standalone character study vaguely inspired by the batman universe. But this is not entirely possible. I was forced to think about it on two levels. With Batman and Without Batman.\nWith Batman, The Joker is on the home turf. There have been many renditions of Joker, and Heath Ledger's portrayal is still vivid in my mind. I knew that Arthur here will go on to become someone who is going to say, “\u200eIntroduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos...”. When I was thinking Joker in the context of Batman, I could not keep Ledger's joker too far away. I was searching for a path for Arthur to go from the mentally unstable to the calculating anarchist. I was left searching for that path when the movie ended. To remain as the crown prince of crime, and to justify the title of the greatest adversary of Batman, just mental instability isn't good enough. He needs to be much more intelligent, much more cunning. These traits are often visible early, In the case of Arthur, I could not find that complete foundation upon which the later psyche can stand. This reminded me of Cameron Monaghan's Jerome Valeska. The joker of my understanding is somewhere between the cruelty of Jerome and pitiable delusions of Arthur. Also, the iconic Batman moment was not needed in this. I kept feeling that Joker is trying to stand with the support of Batman's tale as a clutch. A safety net enforced by the producers.\nOn the other hand, if I consider this movie as a standalone tale, then it was a bit more satisfying. There are tearjerker movies where nothing good ever happens with the protagonist. A series of bad lucks, or difficulties keep blocking a normal life. He is most definitely poor, has a sub-optimal family background, has a medical affliction which is unique and provides a foundation of the pity I felt. This is not very far from Rani Mukharjee's Hichki if you only consider the medical condition. Rani's Naina had Tourette syndrome while Joaquin's Arthur suffers from pseudobulbar affect. The setting and genre make the two films vastly different. More often than not, I have noticed these disorders lift a lot of burden from the narrative. In the case of Joker, couple his disorder with usually being in the wrong place at the wrong time, you have a travesty of human life. Add to that, an unstable parent, amplify it with the volatile societal conditions, you have a perfect decoction of what Joker is made of. As a tale of its own, it works. The delivery is great thanks to the spectacular performance. It also helps to increase the awareness of mental health. But when you strip off all the Batman context, it remains a well-acted and averagely written tale.\nUnfortunately, this is a single film, and I felt it is torn between these two polarising treatments. It wants to find its ground, which it finds. But that ground is far from being sensational. It remains somewhat indecisive. It can not be well soaked in Batman lore like James Gordon's tale, Gotham is. I am considering Gotham because both Gotham and Joker do not feature Batman, but they both have Bruce. Gotham understands its lore and fully embraces it but Joker does not want to. At the same time, as a tale of the psychologically troubled protagonist, Joker tries to play safe with the aim to please audience en-mass. I kept thinking about American Psycho and The Machinist. (Coincidently, both star ex-Batman Christian Bale). Those two take you in the psyche of the protagonist. Those take you inside the burning Amazon and not stand at a safe distance. Joker does not aim to do so.\nI am not at all qualified to talk about the acting performances. Joaquin Phoenix is in every frame and the way he waltzes between emotions is terrifyingly amazing. The Tai Chi to calm himself down, the menacing stare when finally becomes the Joker, those are chilling. He lives the character to the best of his abilities. Regrettably, he does not have the same level of writing support which Heath Ledger had and so due to no fault of his own, Joaquin could not topple Heath Ledger's portrayal of the crown prince of crime.\nIf I consider Todd Philips's entire resume, this was a genre shift for him. He knew very well that the biggest trump card is Joaquin Phoenix, so he takes no risk. He keeps him in focus, almost always all the setting and cinematography works for him. The only exception being Robert De Niro. Robert is allowed to carry his scenes quite independently. I think Todd Philips relied on both these giants to carry their parts. Sadly, I had gone to a theatre which had a bad print or screen so I think I will have to watch it again sometimes to enjoy the cinematography.\nI realised, I kept writing a lot and this is already over a thousand words. If you are here and reading still, I must say thank you. To summarise, The Joker worked for me and I enjoyed it, but I would not consider it the best depication of the iconic villain from comic books. The best may yet come.""], ['90%', 'The Joker is similar to the DC Joker character but is not a criminal genius.

So, I’ll just give my thoughts.\n“Joker” is a fairly basic character study of Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill man who feels increasingly marginalized by an uncaring and brutal society in Gotham City. To start, the characters, except for Arthur himself, are pretty flat. They seem to have little purpose other than to further Arthur’s story. This includes Thomas Wayne, who in other media is portrayed as a man of many dimensions, wealthy but caring, and instilling these values in his son Bruce. Here, he is portrayed as much more uncaring and elitist. Which gives much less of an impact in the inevitable alley scene we see in everything remotely related to Batman. More on this in a minute. It’s important to the point.\nArthur suffers a condition that makes him burst into laughter at inappropriate times. He also has other unspecified mental illnesses. We’re never given the specifics. This is actually a little troubling because of the general depiction of mental illness. It almost seems like they are saying that if someone is mentally ill then they are a ticking time bomb and it’s only a matter of time before they go off. This is not a good look.\nAfter a series of events, Arthur begins spiraling downward, but at the same time realizes how much influence he can have over other people, an aspect of the Joker that isn’t often explored. And this is where the characters other than Arthur being rather flat comes into play.\nThere’s more than one indication that we are actually witnessing these events through Arthur’s eyes. And this creates a brilliant depiction of a narcissistic personality. The only character that gets fully fleshed out is Arthur himself, but he can’t or won’t connect with other people to see their depth. As such, we get to see narcissism from the inside, no connection to others and in fact seeing them as pawns in his own schemes. It’s subtle and definitely not in your face, but if you look carefully, the hints are there.\nThose who fear that ""Joker"" would glorify incel violence or otherwise can rest a little easier, but as I mentioned, the film isn\'t without its troubling portrayals. It does vilify the mentally ill, which creates a whole host of other issues. The movie swings wildly between ""excellent"" and just ""okay,"" and sometimes even ""meh."" As such, it gets a recommendation, but only a mild one.'], ['90%', 'A Masterpiece.\nThe movie shows the escalating events that made Arthur become the Joker.

At least, ignored until they become a Joker.'], ['80%', 'Not fun, but absorbing, artistic and tragic\nA mentally troubled middle-aged clown (Joaquin Phoenix) who lives with his mother (Frances Conroy) in Gotham City goes from not good to worse when he finally realizes his true identity.

Seriously, I do.\nThe score by Hildur Guðnadóttir helped set the tone tremendously. A melancholy tone with a chaotic twist. A representation of Arthur slowly drowning in his own misery and pain. A little fun fact: The score for the film were written based on the script even before the actual filming of the movie started, which I think is the best way to do it, if you ask me. Someone to imagine movie by songs and incorporate their interpretation through music.\nThe cinematography was gorgeous and there’s a handful of shots that has imprinted into my memory. Lawrence Sher does an excellent job off showing the decaying Gotham city and the sewer waste look of the city. Bright neon lights with striking colors that manage to make the most run down of places look pretty.\nI like how they actually gave Thomas Wayne a character rather than “guy gets shot in alleyway”. He’s portrayed as a ruthless man with blunt ways of saving Gotham City. However he loves his wife and son, so his unforgiving attitude was all for the shake of keeping his loved ones safe. He’s also a massive movie buff where he often goes to watch the classics on the big screen. So it’s an interesting take on the character viewed in somebody’s else perspective.\nThere’s a scene where Arthur goes to watch a comedy standup show to take notes on a comedians act. Every time a joke is told and everyone laughs, his face is frozen in place with an unsure grin while his eyes look around the room wondering why everyone’s laughing, but when the laughter dies down he jumps to live with a delayed laugh. It’s moments like that are simple, yet says a lot about him. Basically showing how disconnected he is with humor and everyone else.\nNow lets talk about the controversy that's been surrounding this movie:\nThis is one of the most ludicrous controversy in recent memory. The movie will not cause or inspire violence, but shows why violence happens. I mean, there probably has been incidents when somebody committed a horrendous crime because their were influenced by a movie or a game. However, it’s he/she that should be brought into question, not the creators. Maybe this movie could inspire people to think twice about how they treat others. Why not think about the positives? If “Joker” is going to be responsible for violence and mass shootings, then so is every other movie with any form of violence ever. If people really care about how violence is portrayed in movies, then Rob Zombies ‘3 From Hell’ should also receive the same attention. Just imagine ‘Natural Born Killers’ times 100, but I guess it’s not mainstream enough for any of that. And sure, there’s some brutal and raw approach to violence in ‘Joker’, but we all have seen worst. ‘Deadpool’ is more graphic than this. It's not the directors duty to teach morals to the viewer. People will never learn to stop pointing fingers at things to blame and actually do something about it! People often understandment how much power their got.\nAnywhere, sorry about that folks, just had to get that off my chest. Go and check it out.\nOverall rating: “Send in the clowns” ⇠ you’ve gotta sing that like Frank Sinatra.""], ['-', 'It is intersting to analyze this movie in a context of global increase of violent social movements against the Establishment.

As far as I am concerned this movie is an insult to the fans of Batman and the REAL Joker.\nThe “Joker” in this move is a unintelligent deranged nutcase. There is a sob story in the background about how he became that way which is totally uninteresting.\nThe REAL joker is a intelligent criminal mastermind. I was waiting for this nutcase to actually become that for the entire movie. Spoiler alert, it never happened! This guy starts as a useless sobbing nutcase and he ends the movie as the same useless sobbing nutcase.\nThe movie has NOTHING to do with the real Joker. It is a blatant attempt to garner support for a unrelated psychopathic thriller by using the Joker name. If it would have been advertised as such I probably would have, if not liked it, so at least appreciated it for it’s qualities. It is indeed a well done movie technically and the main character is indeed excellently performed.\nHowever, even if I try to distance myself from the deceitful Joker label, I find it overall boring, too long and really a movie about a psychopath probably made by someone with mental issues himself. But then that’s Hollywood today.\nThat the politically biased and elitist so called “critics” on sites like Rotten Tomatoes like it is not really surprising but I have to confess that I am somewhat surprised at the rave ratings by real viewers on some other sites.\nHonestly, I was expecting to be disappointing by this movie. Then I am always cautious about movies getting rave reviews, especially from the previously mentioned totally useless and crappy “review” site. I did not expect this level of disappointment though. Epic fail as far as I am concerned.']]"

It appears that her new powers connect her to ""Danvers"" (Brie Larson) and her slightly estranged cohort ""Rambeau"" (Teyonah Parris). When they use their powers they find themselves transported into each other\'s shoes - causing mayhem all over the place, especially at the family home of the rookie superhero who is as yet unaware of just quite how powerful her shiny amulet is.

The denouement is never in doubt and actually feels rather rushed after a first half hour of repetitive combat scenes that don\'t draw breath but don\'t really entertain either.

And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta’s third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn’t have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren’t adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren’t explained at all, leaving viewers who aren’t comic book laureates wondering what’s going on (particularly at film’s end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn’t particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture’s pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that’s growing tiresome in the studio’s releases, a development akin to the “Paul is dead” legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there’s the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they’ve been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, “The Marvels” is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that’s troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren’t to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they’re cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication.

I\'m not part of any hate group or factions that hate those hate groups. I just want to watch a good superhero origin film, that introduces me to a new character that I\'m supposed to care about and root for. Read my review, sure, but make up your own mind. Go see the movie and be honest. Since that\'s out of the way, let\'s keep going ...\nIt was always going to be a huge risk trying to introduce such an important and powerful character like Carol Danvers into the end of Phase Three. Not only she comes from nowhere (as far as I remember, she was barely mentioned in previous films or even not mentioned at all before Infinity War), but it\'s the last movie before the climactic, era-ending Avengers: Endgame. She is the one who is going to take our heroes to victory against Thanos, the bad guy who I dare say easily defeated on his own pretty much every superhero we knew until that moment. So, while I was not expecting an outstanding story packed with phenomenal action, I was also hoping for more than just a simple origin film like it came from Phase One.\nUnfortunately, that\'s exactly what I got. Everything is fine. Just okay. There\'s no exceptional fight scene, but most of it is decent. There\'s no visual wonder, but it doesn\'t look bad. The characters\' potential feels wasted, but they work for the plot. Everything is frustratingly balanced, which is something I would praise in a bunch of other movies, but this isn\'t 2008 anymore. Marvel isn\'t starting its cinematic universe, it is almost finishing a whole arc involving more than 20 installments! I\'m going straight to the one character everyone wants to talk about: Goose ... Sorry, Captain Marvel! Jokes aside, this is one of the issues I was worried about going into the film theater. I escaped 99% of the marketing for this movie as I do with every other flick. I didn\'t watch a single clip/trailer, I know as much about the controversy surrounding this installment as my dog and I kept my expectations realistic having in mind what I truly know about the film and only the film itself. The one thing I was not able to hide from were the headlines giving tremendous praise to ... a cat.\nNow, follow me on this: I\'m going to watch a superhero origin movie. A whole new character is waiting for me at the big screen. I\'m excited to know more about her, where does she come from, what her powers are and so much more. Some headlines show up on my social media feed, and I find that a CAT ""steals the show,"" ""deserves a spin-off,"" and I don\'t even know what more. Granted, the cat is indeed funny. It provides some chuckles here and there. That\'s it. I love cats, but I honestly can\'t figure out why everyone is so amazed by an animal doing animal things. Maybe it\'s because the rest of the film isn\'t that entertaining ... or perhaps just because people really, really love cats. Like the movie itself, I think it\'s a mixture of both options.\nBack to what matters and to who everyone should be talking about: Brie Larson. Marvel rarely misses its casting choices, and being Larson an Academy-Award winner, her talent is undeniable. She has everything she needs to consistently deliver a strong performance, so I\'m surprised that she couldn\'t stand out from the film\'s overall blandness. I repeat, the movie isn\'t bad, at all. However, I was expecting an actress of Brie Larson\'s caliber to elevate, at least, her own character, but she\'s like everyone else: just good enough. I don\'t know if her performance was limited by bad direction or by her own decisions, but the potential is there, and I\'m sure the Russo brothers will give her a much more thrilling arc in Endgame.\nThe two best attributes of the entire film are, without a single doubt, the buddy-cop relationship that Carol and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) develop, and the groundbreaking de-aging CGI. Story-wise, the interactions between these two characters are so captivating and humorous that the pacing issues of the first act gradually start to disappear. Carol\'s past is often approached with quick flashes and a lot of cheap exposition, so it\'s a breath of fresh air to have SLJ and Larson play off of each other. Nevertheless, the de-aging technology used is absolutely astounding. My fellow readers, welcome to the future of filmmaking, where any actor/actress can portray a younger version of themselves and not be visually disturbing. I completely forgot SLJ is 70-years-old! The best visual effects/CGI are the ones you don\'t even know they\'re there and Captain Marvel succeeds in delivering mind-blowing, realistic, younger versions of well-known actors.\nCharacter-wise, Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck should have done way better. So much wasted potential in such a crucial moment in the MCU. Carol Danvers has a great backstory, but the way it was explored kind of diminishes its impact. Still, as Captain Marvel, she is indeed a badass woman! There are some cool action sequences, especially in the beginning, but as the movie slowly progresses on its story, the fight scenes got more sloppy, choppy and way too dark. Jude Law (Yon-Rogg) is amazing as he always is, and Ben Mendelsohn is brilliant as Talos. Both characters have interesting subplots that come together well, which is not something that can be said for the rest of the Marvel ""villains.""\nTechnically ... You guessed it, it\'s okay! Taking away the jaw-dropping de-aging CGI, the visuals seem to lack some sort of style. Looking back at Black Panther, Captain America or Guardians of the Galaxy, each movie has a visual aesthetic that belongs to their own stories. Captain Marvel doesn\'t really feel like it has its own style. I truly feel that with other directors, this film could have been way better. Boden and Fleck already proved that they are capable filmmakers, but maybe they were not ready to lead such a massive blockbuster. That said, the 90s score is awesome and quite adequate to the movie\'s period. There are a couple of moments where the VFX regarding Carol Danvers\'s powers are spectacular, but everything ultimately feels like this is a Phase One film, instead of the 21st MCU installment.\nAll in all, Captain Marvel achieves the minimum requirements: introduce the fans to a new superhero, who is going to be extremely important in the eventual defeat of Thanos. Carol Danvers is a fascinating character with an emotional backstory, but the screenplay isn\'t structured or explored in the most entertaining way possible. Brie Larson delivers a strong performance, pushing aside her haters, even if I feel that under other directors, she would have reached her character\'s full potential. Her scenes with Samuel L .Jackson are hilarious and the best part of the whole movie, as well as the groundbreaking de-aging CGI, which is absolutely mind-blowing. The action sequences needed better editing and some more choreography (this is MCU\'s Phase Three and 2019, so I want to be able to actually see what\'s happening), but the most prominent ""issue"" is how the story blindly obeys the superhero origin film\'s formula. This isn\'t exactly a flaw or a problem, it\'s just that I was expecting more. A lot more.\nIn the end, there\'s not a memorable fight scene, an emotionally overwhelming moment or even a genuinely bone-chilling, epic scene. It doesn\'t leave you salivating for Avengers: Endgame, but it also doesn\'t leave you less excited. Everything is just ... fine. And there\'s nothing wrong with that. But there\'s also nothing extraordinary.\nRating: B-'], ['40%', 'Captain Marvel bored the living hell out of me.

Such is the case with “X,” the first film in his series of slashers (including the prequel, “Pearl,” and the upcoming “MaXXXine,” which is currently in development). While “X” was released first, I would still recommend watching “Pearl” beforehand. Either order is fine, but I think screening the prequel and keeping the actual story timeline in order makes the most sense if you’re just starting out. “X” features grindhouse style horror that offers an homage to 1970s classics like “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” but the film also lends a unique, fresh spin on the genre.\nThe year is 1979, and aspiring adult film actress Maxine Minx (Mia Goth) is joined by her cast and crew (Brittany Snow, Kid Cudi, Jenna Ortega, Owen Campbell, and Martin Henderson) to make a different kind of pornographic picture. The group ventures to a remote farmhouse in rural Texas to shoot their film, but something feels “off” about the elderly property owners Howard and Pearl (Stephen Ure and Goth, in a dual role). Their reclusive hosts are unaware of what’s going on out back until they catch the performers in the act. This sets off a chain of very violent events that has everyone fighting for their lives.\nThe retro horror setting serves the story well, even if it has the most basic of plots. What makes this script (penned by West) stand out is the dry humor and interesting, well-written characters that have a lot of depth. It doesn’t take long to start to like and care for these people, which makes their inevitable demise hit a little harder. West’s script includes themes of aging, ambition, voyeurism, and jealousy, all tied together with the joy of setting yourself free from repression. Stifled desire causes the elderly couple to begin their killing spree, but there is so much more underneath the carnage.\nThe film features explicit bloody violence, gore, nudity, and sex, earning its hard “R” rating. West doesn’t turn his camera from the bloodshed even when the audience instinctively looks away. If you aren’t accustomed to horror, this film may not be for you.\nThe cast is comprised of terrific indie actors who trust their director onscreen and off, which shows in their work. Being able to feel so free in front of the camera makes it an easier task to also stand behind it, and all of this results in great entertainment for the audience. The movie is fun and smart, if uncomplicated.\n“X” ends with a wholly satisfying finale and avoids the pitfalls of frustrating the audience, as so many independent horror films seem to do. It’s a slower burn for sure, but what a rewarding ride.']]"

Like all the Chris Nolan fans, I was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. But I slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3D film. I agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. All the credit must go to Nolan brothers. A good sign from Jonathan Nolan, who can make big in the entertainment industry in a future like his brother.\nAs we know many had liked 'Inception', to me that was a simple multi-layered action movie, that's all. But the same stuffs that used in this film makes sense. In fact, you have to have a little knowledge over how the universe works, so then it will be easy to catch the scene and situations while watching the movie. Totally like a documentary style concept, but with the additional stuffs like characters and its emotions add flavor that gives a movie look. An educational movie, though it also can work for those who wants just entertainment. Only the slow movie pace would test their patience.\nIt all begins like Shyamalan's 'Signs' movie with a family living surrounded by corn field. Then switches to 'The Astronaut Farmer' and going through 'Gravity', finally meets the 'Inception'. It was just a reference to call the movie setting that brings constant change for every half an hour. Like the opening scene and the end scene had over a 100 years difference.\nAs I earlier said it was the story of a family alongside the future of humankind and decoding universal mysteries through travelling in space and time. This movie would a reasonable for those who thought '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a boring piece, Cleverly written cinematic piece especially for science geeks. I don't know how perfect the movie to the actual present astrophysics, but will justify for the common people's capacity of understanding with an encourageable amount of commercial elements in it to entertain as well.\nThe first three quarters of the movie was well made. It puts me in a unblinkable position like a story was narrated by Brian Cox in a television series. Like I said, lots of astrophysics involved in it, but strangely human emotions were also exhibited equally that I never expected one from Nolan film. It was not an ordinary sentiment, but was strong enough to make a man cry for happy and sad situations in the movie. I liked science and emotion coming together. In fact, it saved the movie, otherwise it would have been a science documentary straight from NASA production through Nolan direction.\nThere are many surprise elements in the movie and of course there is a twist at the end. We can call it a series of twists like the layers. Compared to last quarter of the movie to the rest, it completely detaches which opens broadly to the different directions. And that happens so fast rushing towards the other end. Which give an impression of the movie 'Inception'. In a perfect way to say the first 75% was 'The Tree of Life' and the remains are 'Inception'.\n‘‘This world's a treasure,\nbut it's been telling us to leave for a while now.’’\nAll the actors were so good. Matthew McConaughey steals the show as he dominates the majority of the screen space in the story presentation. There's no ruling out the fine performance executions from Anne Hathaway and the young star from the Twilight movie, Mackenzie Foy. The remaining cast was having less scope which were like the guest appearances that was widened a little broader, but was perfectly fitted for the story. Especially Matt Damon's was the crucial one.\nRemember the movie 'Contact', a lovely movie, which was ruined by its fictional ending. Something like that happened in this film as well. The story was initiated with a realistic approach with actual scientific contents as per the present understanding about the universe. But the end was let me down with the layered contents that kind of impossible to agree with it. As a cinematic theme it worked, yeah, a good solution for this wonderfully written story. We know that the time can't run backwards, so that's the trouble.\nAnyway, this movie defines in a new way, I mean scientifically the existence of ghost. It was not a horror movie, but I liked supernatural force that merged with this science fiction theme. That explains and gives vast ideas to expand our physics beyond something and somewhere yet to reach. Hats off to the director, because he was not thinking of making money here. His idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. And he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions. In my opinion, this will replace '2001: A Space Odyssey' for sometime till another one make this way.\nI could have not asked a better space travel drama than this, especially when I heard Nolan doing a science-fiction I believed he gonna rock it. He was so true to the science and the human feelings in this film. If you had seen enough movies before like this one, you can recall your memories like the Tom Hanks parts from 'Cloud Atlas'. But still independently stands strong and falls in a never seen before category.\n‘‘Maybe we've spent too long\ntrying to figure all this out with theory.’’\nThe end scene leaves a hint of a possible sequel. I would be happy if that happen in a near future, but definitely that would be a completely different cinema as per how this one ended. I know his fans want that to happen and so am I.\nThe visuals were not that great, but simply very good. To see those in digital 3D would have given us a different experience, sadly Nolan was not in favor of that technology. Hoping this movie would get as many as the Oscars nod. Especially not getting into the best motion picture shortlist would be a shame. Like I said I'm no one fan, I just love watching everyone's every movie. I would have went to see it again if it was converted into digital 3D, since I'm modern tech geek when it comes to the films.\nIt will become a talk of the week, perhaps month all over the world, so don't leave behind when your friends talk about it. What I gonna say is it is a must see asap if you are a movie fanatic like me otherwise Nolan movies does not need anyone's recommendation because his movies usually sell itself like the hot samosa.""], ['95%', ""People seem to think that if you enjoy a Christopher Nolan movie, you are a fanboy and the film couldn't really be that good. That is not true. He has never made a bad movie, Insomnia is probably his worst and it is still an excellent movie. \nInterstellar is up there in his top 3, with The Dark Knight being number 1 and Inception in number 2. I don't think he will ever make a better movie than The Dark Knight, it is without a doubt a masterpiece of cinema in my opinion. It can be enjoyed on so many levels.\nI remember seeing Interstellar in the movie theater and being on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was breathtaking but the end left me confused so i walked out disappointed. \nSince then i have watched it many times but it only took a second viewing to realize what a great ending it is and here is why. How many people discuss the end, was the wormhole open or closed for him to make it to Brand, what happens next, is there a sequel. I discuss this with people who hate the movie and the debate will still last a good 30 minutes if not more without getting heated. It is a wonderful story told through the eyes of a genius film maker who deserves more than he receives, an oscar would be nice start.\nI read hat his next movie is to be released in July 2017, I can't wait to find out everything about it like i have since he began.\nIf you're unsure about Christopher Nolan, watch his career from the beginning starting with Doodlebug.""], ['70%', ""Another grandiloquent movie from Christoper Nolan.\nThe cast is good, and McConaughey performs a role made for himself.

I can safely say that it has been a long LONG time since a movie had this much effect on me after watching it. And the only thing I can think of now is to somehow Re-Watch it again.\nThis movie was surprisingly different from Christopher Nolan\'s recent works because they had been great cinematic entertainment pieces catered to a wider audience with a blockbuster approach, this certainly didn\'t felt like that and hence the polarizing response it got. It is an ambitious project that is not meant to merely entertain, walk into it knowing that. I\'ll say this though, If it works for you, you\'ll be in heaven.\nThe premise of the movie is that Earth is no longer capable of supporting humans on it, we must find a new home to avoid extinction. This scenario is told from a very personal perspective and not from a Global scale like some sort of apocalyptic catastrophe disaster film. At the core of the movie is the Father-Daughter relationship. The movie takes its sweet time to develop it too.\nMathew McConaughey, not surprisingly, gives an amazing performance as the main lead. He really carries the film, some scenes were very emotional due to his great performance. The rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially the Daughter played by Meckenzie Foy. The One character that I never expected to be great was the robot TARS. He also acted as the source of the humor in the movie, well executed, timely and grounded.\nInterstellar tackles a lot of themes, Survival, Humankind, Love, Time etc, out of which \'Time\' had the biggest impact on me. With relativity being a big part in the film, the whole sequence about it just struck me very deeply and I found new respect for Time. I\'m actually at a loss of words to describe it. Also, there is a lot science in it so it can be confusing for many and in Nolan\'s tradition, it also has twists and mind numbing ending, where the more you think about it, the more numbing it gets.\nThe visuals of this movie are breathtaking. Great cinematography and CGI. The depiction of wormholes and blackholes and other space entities were the best I have ever seen. They just suck you into the movie. Along with that, you get to listen to one of Hans Zimmer\'s best scores. The score not only felt personal, going perfectly with the movie, but also different from his recent works. There were times where combination of epic photography and soundtrack made the scenes timeless, like I was completely sucked into it and didn\'t had a clue about my surroundings. I didn\'t want those scenes to end.\nAlas, the movie was not perfect. My biggest gripe with it is that the pacing and editing was off at times. Some scenes dragged on while others were cut far shorter. The beautiful views of space could have definitely benefited from a few seconds longer onscreen time. Also, I wished there was more space exploration in it.\nWith all the remakes, rehashes, reboots and sequels we are getting in these times, it is great to see original gems like these. This movie is definitely one of this year\'s best, one of Nolan\'s best work and one of the best movie I have seen in recent years.\n9.5/10'], ['100%', ""This was my most anticipated film of 2014, and I was not disappointed.\nThe story was slightly difficult to follow on the first watch, but that was to be expected in a film dealing with complicated fields such as astrophysics and time dilation. Many didn't find its overall message - that love is the most powerful force in the universe which transcends space and time - to be very appealing, but I thought it was an interesting take on special relativity and how two people can be bound by a common feeling, even when they're in different parts of the universe at different times. I also thought the acting was believable, for the most part, and I didn't think anyone was miscast. I enjoyed the surprise appearance from a certain famous actor about halfway through.\nBut what really blew me away were the visuals and the soundtrack. I believe it was Quentin Tarantino who once said movies and music go hand in hand; that a moving image complimented by the right piece of music can create art. Well, the visuals in this film, which took my breath away, and the score, which perfectly captured the 'feel' of the cosmos and all its wonder, proved him right. I think this was Hans Zimmer's best work yet, and although I'm not Christopher Nolan's biggest fan, I will continue to follow his work if he can pull off more movies like this.\nMy only regret was not seeing this film in IMAX.\n10/10""], ['40%', 'That this movie, at the time of writing this, holds an 8.8 rating at IMDb is simply beyond my understanding. Needless to say I did not really like this movie. The story is not very good, the science is ludicrous and the visuals not all that impressive. Maybe the latter would be better in a big theater (I watched this on my home cinema system which has a relatively large screen by European standards) but I am not really sure about that either.\nBe warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.\nThe movie starts of with the usual “I told you so” wet dream of the green fanatics on a dying Earth so it is off to a depressing start right away. That is an overused concept today as far as I am concerned. Then they pour it on with a school official claiming that he Apollo missions and moon landings never happened. What the f…? If they wanted to depress the audience right from the start they succeeded, at least with this audience.\nThe story proceeds with our heroes finding these gravity waves in the sand and by a huge stretch of imagination decrypts them to mean coordinates which leads them to the secret NASA base. Once there Cooper is told that he is their best choice of pilot for a “save the human race” mission through a wormhole. Yeah, right! This guy was former NASA. His whereabouts could hardly been unknown to them. If he was their best choice why would they entrust a mission to save the human race to someone else until he stumbled onto their door? Typical Hollywood nonsense!\nThe movie is full of this kind of rubbish. Romilly wastes 23 years of his life doing pretty much nothing except deciding not to go into the sleep capsule. The supposedly highly trained and vetted professor that they do find turns out to be a psychopath as well as and idiot almost blowing up the ship when trying to proceed with a docking that all the systems tells him have not succeeded. Then they proceed to dock with the main ship and stop its spin as well as bring it out of orbit around a planet with the shuttles engines. That is one hell of a powerful shuttle not to mention the strength of the docking mechanism! This just goes on. When someone is not doing something illogical or stupid (or both) they sit around talking, philosophizing and dragging the movie forward at snails pace. 169 minutes is way too much for this movie.\nThe movie ends up in one big time travel mess (okay they do not travel in time, just sends messages through time but still…) during a bunch of psychedelic scenes while traveling through the back hole.

The performances of Wolverine and Prof. X by Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are extraordinary. They create a believable and loving father-son bond between their characters, with Logan caring for the ninety year old leader of the X-Men after a horrible event occurs at the Xavier school the year before. Stephen Merchant takes over the role of Caliban from Tómas Lemarquis, who played the character in X-Men Apocalypse, and transforms him into an ally to Logan and Charlies. Merchant is quite good in the role. But what really dragged down the movie is its nihilism. The other X-Men are completely missing from the film and mutants have been wiped out almost completely. A sense of doom and hopelessness looms over the film. This movie completely upends the warm and hopeful epilogue of Days of Future Past, where the X-Men were restored to life and glory and mutants weren't extinct after all. Death seems to stalk Logan and Charles wherever they go. There is also a conspicuous lack of significant female characters in this movie, too. The only female of note is Laura/ X-23, and she spends most of the film mute. There is also a complete lack of any strong or memorable villains.

Yet Logan had been the precious gem in the crown of 'X-Men', that mean it won't be the same anymore.\nAfter many years passed in the future, the last survivours of mutants hiding their identity and living among the humans. Logan and two others were attacked by the armed men when he decided to help a child mutant. Running away from them and looking for a place where they can be safe prioritised in the narration. More dramatised film in the franchise, but there are enough actions those who desire for that.\nIt's an emotional time for the hardcore fans of Logan/Hugh Jachman. One final great performance by him and the little kid was also good. A well shot film, with minimum graphics and more realistic stunt sequences. Well, not all were real, too strong fights, too bloody, despite having a child actor in it. Yeah, it is a good film, I liked it, but not a masterpiece as you might have heard of. But anyway, it is a must see for the 'Wolverine' fans.\n7/10""], ['40%', 'I believe that I am about to disagree with quite a few people now. You see, I did not like this movie.\nNot that this came as much of a surprise to me. What I got was pretty much what I expected. From a technical point of view the movie is quite well done. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are doing good jobs as always. The action scenes are good. The cinematography is not at all bad. If you are into tragic drama and do not mind the super hero twist of the movie then this is a movie for you. The technical qualities is why this movie gets any stars at all from me. If I would judge it by story only then it would have gotten zero, null, nada, nicths, rien, ingenting.\nFor me it was depressing, boring and not at all fun to watch. The only reason I watched it is because I, as a X-Men fan, simply had to watch it as well as having it in my collection but I would have been happier it this movie had never been made.\nWolverine is more or less an unpleasant drinking bum clad in filthy ragged clothes. Professor X is half insane and apparently dangerous to himself and the people around him. We get absolutely no explanation as to how this sad state of affairs.\nThe entire movie is dark in spirit with the X-Men all but died out and Wolverine and Professor X just waiting to die. Then in comes this female child who later turns out to be a female version of Wolverine. She pretty much lacks any form of charisma and she and Wolverine spends almost the entire time in a state of conflict, much due to Wolverine who seems to think everyone should go fuck themselves so that he can continue to self destruct.\nThe bad guys are the usual evil corporation doing experiments on X-Men, genetics etc. Supposedly they were behind the almost extermination of X-Men but of course they keep their own little army of “enhanced” humans that doggedly harasses Wolverine & Co. There are some nice action sequences but there is really no good overall boss. No one with enough Charisma to take the role of the main adversary unless you count X-24 who only took part in a few parts of the movie.\nBy the way, why the fuck do Wolverine, Laura as well as X-24 have to grunt like horny monkeys when they fight?\nThe story is rather predictable with no major surprises, little depth and low on logic. A typical Hollywood drama. Not really anything to write home about.\nThe movie is just so depressing from start to finish. As a last farewell to Wolverine and Professor X it is almost insulting. I know a lot of people seem to like it but I cannot understand why. At least not if you are a X-Men fan.'], ['100%', 'The Last Cut Is The Deepest!\nDid we need another X-Men movie? In fact did we need another Wolverine movie? Well the result is there for all to see, with Logan not only showing itself to be undoubtedly the best Wolverine venture by far, but arguably the best X-Men picture as well. If, as expected (and surely to god it\'s hoped so), this is the last we see of the grumpy metal clawed superhero, then what a fitting and triumphant bow out it is.\nJames Mangold, the director, has managed to create an adult superhero movie without it really being a superhero pic, for he has created a film noir Western that happens to be about a superhero. Mangold\'s love of noir and Westerns bursts from the screen, which for those who follow those wonderful stands of cinema, will come as no surprise having seen with notice his Copland and 3:10 To Yuma redux. There\'s a perpetual grimness to the narrative that belies the quite often stunning surrounding locales, heavy themes such as men out of time - with destinies written (cue a deft comic book movie within a comic book chunk of metaphysics) - surrogates, mental illness, human ignorance, and on it goes, the narrative strong on intelligence as much as it is in wrought emotion. Western fans will also be buoyed by the part that the 1953 classic Western Shane has to play in things, considerably so as its importance narratively, orally and visually is mightily strong.\nLogan\'s Run!\nAh yes, well being ""adult"" is all well and good, but is Logan thrilling? Do we get pumped up Wolverine action, blood brains, splatter and mucho muscle flexing and pained roars of anger? Oh yes! Action from the off is never far away, and wonderfully staged and choreographed it is. Lots of memorable set-pieces, while also some cleverly constructed sequences such as Xavier\'s mind seizures hold court and enthral. Yet the kicker with all that is we are clued in to the emotional baggage that the side-burn sporting protag carries with him. With each fight we sense the bigger picture, even as we watch in awe the emergence of Laura (ironic film noir name right there as it happens) - and her part in this very ""human"" story - the thrills and spills are propelled by a meaningful but battered heart.\nTech credits are superb. Acting honours go to Jackman, who after giving 17 years of his life to the character, gives it his all and this multi faceted performance, in a perfect world, deserves Oscar recognition. Patrick Stewart, also, is immense, playing the nonagenarian Charles Xavier with such class, gracefulness and storming emotion that one can only admire. Film debutante Dafne Keen as Laura is utterly engrossing, quite a debut indeed, whilst Stephen Merchant as albino mutant tracker Caliban is effective to the point we hanker for more. Although the villains fronted by Boyd Holbrook (rote henchman leader) and Richard E. Grant (smarmy scientist git) just about pass muster, there\'s nothing to damage the piece. Cinematography (John Mathieson) is ""A"" grade, the filters set on neo-noir, with the splendid film noir black and white version a fillip for the heart of noir lovers. All that is left is for the sound mix to boom and the director to steer with heart, brain and soul, without doubt both come up trumps.\nOne of 2017s best films, a genre splicer that ticks all the boxes of great film making. 10/10'], ['70%', 'All but exhausted after years of fighting and hiding, ""Logan"" (Hugh Jackman) just wants a peaceful life.

""Pierce"" (Boyd Holbrook) has been charged by scientist ""Rice"" (Richard E. Grant) to track her down and capture her. It now falls to our eponymous hero to fend them off and get her to safety. What follows now are several highly polished, but frankly repetitive, escapades as their enemies close in. Sure, the effects are great and the production quality is top drawer, but the flaw with someone who has (albeit limited, by this stage) self healing powers is that the same, or slightly tweaked, scenarios happening over and over again start to get a bit dull after a while. Jackman looks as tired with the role as his character is with the relentlessness of his existence and though quite easy on the eye, Holbrook isn\'t up to much (I kept thinking he was Charlie Hunnam). I was never the biggest fan of this franchise once they split it out to follow ""Wolverine"". Jackman is an hugely charismatic actor but his character isn\'t remotely sophisticated and though there is some humour to be found, for the most part I found this an action-packed but pretty long and unremarkable piece of cinema.'], ['70%', 'Logan tones down the effects and scale to focus on the emotion and pain of its characters, making it one of the best films in the X-Men saga.\nJames Mangold strikes again! Logan is considered by many to be one of the greatest superhero films ever made. While I don’t feel as strongly as many about this film, its quality is undeniable. Jackman and Stewart’s performances were the best of the franchise. The story adapts the Old Man Logan comic to depict an aged weary Wolverine that is more jaded and bitter than ever. This new world where the X-Men have all perished or disappeared is more dangerous than ever for mutants. But Logan’s heart is slowly restored by a young girl on the run that seems destined to follow in his footsteps unless he finds a way to give her a new future and hope. Mangold’s vision and directing fill the film with emotion and pain. Logan’s suffering and hopelessness are tangible and felt in every moment of the film. While I missed the vibe and characters of the other X-Men movie, Logan was an excellent film that gave a meaningful conclusion to Wolverine’s long and heartbreaking journey.']]"

As the rightful successor to the throne, he must tangle with his brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) to save the surface world from destruction. Meanwhile Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) seeks vengeance on Arthur for the death of his father.\n“Aquaman” (2018) is a colorful superhero flick featuring a flashy action scene for every 5 minute lull. It’s reminiscent of “Thor” (2011) and “Thor: The Dark World” (2013), but with spectacular undersea realms instead of Asgard & realms nearby. Yet the drama was better in those movies whereas here it feels like the creators were in a rush to jump to the next action sequence, which might make “Aquaman” ‘thrilling,’ but less compelling story-wise.\nStill, it’s very eventful with loads of energy (maybe TOO eventful for its own good). And I liked the balance of underwater scenes to surface scenes with spectacular locations, including the Sahara Desert and Sicily. Meanwhile Amber is stunning as redheaded Mera. Even Nicole Kidman shows up as Arthur’s mother, Atlanna. Speaking of Arthur, Momoa is magnificent as the protagonist and will forever change the public’s generally weak perception of Aquaman.\nThe film is a bit overlong at 2 hour, 23 minutes; and was shot in Australia (Hastings Point, Amity Point, Southport, Main Beach & Currumbin Beach); Newfoundland & Labrador, Canada; and Morocco (Erfoud & Merzouga).\nGRADE: B'], ['70%', 'Good movie to watch.'], ['80%', 'I just came back home from watching Aquaman on the IMAX theater in Balexert in Geneva and thought that I should write something up while it’s still fresh in my mind. Something that happens all too rarely.\nI have to say that, overall, I had quite a blast watching this movie. It is indeed a good superhero and special effects extravaganza. In addition it is quite beautiful. A lot of the underwater scenes are very pleasing on the eye indeed. I am quite happy that I managed to drag my ass over to a theater and watch it on a IMAX screen. Some of the hype around it is perhaps a bit too much though. It does not quite reach the masterpiece level after all.\nStorywise, well it is a superhero movie after all so if you expect the story to be profound, logical and watertight you should lay off those mushrooms or whatever you are smoking. That said, the story was not too bad. Pretty straightforward and not too convoluted. A good, solid story suitable for a action/adventure movie.\nI did quite like the main protagonists on the good side. Especially Jason Momoa as Aquaman. I mean his time-to-kick-some-ass-stare was just so…evil. The script writer had put some stupid shit in there where he had to play overly dumb at times but on the whole he was a good guy throughout the entire movie. Almost no whining, angst and anti-hero shit like what have totally ruined most of the Marvel TV-shows lately.\nThe bad guys were not too bad either. Orm was lacking a bit in the bad guy charisma department but Black Manta was oozing despicable bad bad bad asshole from the first scene to the last. I probably should not say this because his weird helmet is indeed true to the comics but, well, it’s weird and kind of looks better in a comics than on the big screen.\nSpecial effects? Well, there is not that much to say really. They are pretty awesome throughout the movie and, as I wrote above, a lot of the time they are also beautiful. The various creatures, underwater vehicles and gadgets are really cool and well designed.\nThe one gripe I have about the movie is the totally unnecessary green preaching crap. Luckily it is confined to a couple of scenes but in those it is really slapped in the audience’s faces. A superhero movie should be entertaining, not preaching.

The DCEU has really mastered its fight choreography allowing for the directors to get wide, interesting shots of the action without having to add unnecessary cuts. There were so many fight sequences that had me thoroughly impressed with the creativity and the scope of the action. I particularly like how James Wan was able to transition across to the battlefield to show individual fights. It gave them a sense of connectedness that is sorely missing in many superhero films today.\nThe plot of this film had me intrigued, although it does tend to get quite weighed down by how involved the movie is. There are so many kingdoms of Atlantis involved and their relationships can get a tad confusing during the first watch. I was constantly trying to understand the relationships between all of the main members of Atlantis, but luckily, I could grasp the gist of what the story was trying to tell. I really appreciated the fantasy parallels that the directors were going for when it came to Atlantis. It gave it a grand feel on scale to a light version of Game of Thrones. The diversity of the nations was a really nice touch as well, I found it fascinating how each nation evolved independently from each other. The main criticism that I have with the story is the writing. There are so many scenarios or lines of dialogue that were incredibly awkward to watch. I think James Wan was really out of his element writing this movie compared to his cookie cutter horror films that he has built his reputation on. Hopefully he can learn from his mistakes for the sequel.\nI was not overly impressed with the acting in this film either. Jason Mamoa was acceptable as Aquaman but like I said previously there were quite a bit of lines that were delivered awkwardly. I found that the comedic timing of the jokes did not really land and felt out of place in this film. The chemistry between Mamoa and Amber Heard was non-existent, I did not buy for a second that the two were truly in love and the whole build up to the relationship felt incredibly forced. Willem Dafoe was excellent as always and Patrick Wilson was fairly adequate as well. This film had an all-star cast, so it is odd to me that so many lines were delivered awkwardly, I think it is more so on the writing and direction rather than the actors' abilities.\nEven with all my complaints about the film, I still found myself having a good time.

I also saw the more modern animations, in digital format, but I can't help but think that the classic material is better, and the stories presented are much more engaging. In any case, trying to compare the 2004 film to any of the Garfield animations or comic books is a real trial by fire: the film is considerably weaker, even though it has certain positive points that deserve our attention.\nThe film was directed by a certain Joel Cohen, who is not the same Joel from the Cohen Brothers, he is another person with an identical name, who I didn't know. The director doesn't seem to me to have been the best student in the directing class at film school... notice how the film was poorly edited and unfolds unevenly, wasting a lot of time on uninteresting things just to rush near the end. In addition to the pacing problems, the film lacks a good soundtrack and some comic “spark” that gives it soul and charm. Although sarcasm works effectively and is a very solid characteristic of the character, Garfield manages to be funnier and more charismatic than this cat in this film, and most of the jokes sound hollow, especially to adults.\nThe script, instead of taking advantage of the wealth of Garfield that exists in comics and animations, serves us a story that is dull, uninteresting, poorly written and full of clichés. It seems that the production only had people who didn't like, or didn't know, the character: the film only talks about the friendship between Garfield and Oddie, a cat and a dog who will have to learn to share the attention of their owner, Jon. There is an attempt to do anything more than that by inserting a villain who acts like Cruella De Vil, trying to use animals for his selfish purposes. In the end, he looks like Mufasa in the hands of the hyenas in “Lion King”: the scenes are identical, a copy that shows the void of ideas in that production room.\nHowever, despite all these problems being worthy of consideration, the film has quality elements, starting with the CGI and digital animation, which were inserted into the conventional filming with great technical skill. Even for the beginning of the century, it's a reasonably convincing film, with one drawback: Garfield's character. Being a “live action” film where all the characters, human or not, are real and similar to their animated counterparts, why didn’t they do the same with the orange cat? The cat remains equal to the animated one, and is the only one, brutally clashing with everything! For a practical example, compare Garfield to Oddie or even Nermal: the two characters look much better than the animated cat.\nAs for the actors, the film seems to have made safe bets on competent people who could add some talent to the film and guarantee a minimum of quality: Jennifer Love Hewitt does a very competent job, but it is a film that she cannot save, she is in a position too secondary to do it; Bill Murray, despite only lending his voice to the cat, is the ideal actor to do it. Not only does he have the most suitable tone and voice, he also has an extraordinary comedic streak and ability to make jokes loaded with sarcasm. However, even he knows this film is weak, despite the cash he received for lending his voice! Stephen Tobolowsky is a weak, pantomime villain, with no personality or ability to threaten, and Brekin Meyer doesn't give Jon a personality worthy of our esteem, he turns him into a sympathetic fool.""]]"

From start to finish, this movie delivers an adrenaline-fueled experience that will leave you breathless. The action is intense, with each fight scene being expertly choreographed and executed. The action set pieces are some of the most memorable I've ever seen, with each one being more jaw-dropping than the last.\nOne of the standout aspects of John Wick 4 is the villains. This time around, they are more interesting than ever, with big-name actors bringing their A-game to their respective roles. It's always great to see veteran actors like Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne on screen, but the addition of newcomers like Bill Skarsgard and Donnie Yen really elevates the movie.\nBut perhaps the real star of John Wick 4 is the fight cinematography. The one-take fight scene that was filmed from overhead is a work of art. It's so seamless and fluid that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action. The attention to detail in every fight scene is astounding, with each punch and kick feeling like it has real weight behind it.\nOne slight negative of the movie is that John Wick doesn't have much development. However, this is a minor quibble, as the movie is so focused on delivering incredible action that the lack of character development doesn't really matter. After all, John Wick is at his best when he's kicking ass, and he certainly does that in spades in this movie.\nOverall, John Wick 4 is a fantastic entry in the series. The sense of finality that permeates throughout the movie is perfect, and it really feels like a fitting end to the story. If you're a fan of action movies, then John Wick 4 is an absolute must-see. It's a thrilling ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.\nScore: 93%\nVerdict: Excellent""]]"

Jackson), their mob boss & his wife (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a champion boxer who incurs the wrath of the boss (Bruce Willis).\nThe lurid, droll tale is told in a non-linear fashion, but it\'s easy to follow and the final act ties everything up nicely. The dialogue\'s witty and the story maintains your attention, despite its 2 hour and 34 minutes runtime. The film\'s stylish and pulsates with energy and innovation; it understandably influenced many 90\'s films and beyond.\nI put off seeing this iconic picture until almost twenty years after its release because the protagonists are all big city gangsters or somehow involved with \'em. These are lawless people who would kill a person without batting an eye. Their god is money or hedonism. Let ’em shoot each other to smithereens for all I care. But if you can look beyond this and the constant profanities, the film\'s worth your time. What redeems it for me, besides the all-around entertaining movie-making, is that it\'s a tale of redemption and the high price of stubborn folly: The wise person recognizes God’s grace and responds accordingly while the fool doesn’t and blithely goes on his (doomed) way. Once a person receives grace they naturally extend it to others. There are additional gems spiced throughout.\nBoth Travolta and Jackson shine here. There are several other celebrities on hand, like Harvey Keitel, with many in cameos, e.g. Christopher Walken; not to mention several formidable females, like curvy Julia Sweeney (Raquel), cutie Maria de Medeiros (Fabienne), Angela Jones (Esmarelda) and voluptuous Susan Griffiths (Marilyn Monroe).\nBOTTOM LINE: If you\'re in the mood for a quirky crime drama/thriller you can\'t go wrong with ""Pulp Fiction."" It\'s top-of-the-line in every way, including the subtext.\nTHE FILM WAS SHOT in the Greater Los Angeles area.

""Winnfield"" (Samuel L. Jackson) and ""Vincent Vega"" (John Travolta) are a pair of dapper enforcers, despatched to retrieve a stolen briefcase. Though their manner may be precise, the execution of their tasks are usually more hit and miss, definitely messy - and frequently requiring of the specialist clean-up services of ""Mr. Wolf"" (Harvey Keitel). ""Vega"" is also charged by his boss with looking after his cocaine-loving wife ""Mia"" (Uma Thurman) and that flirts with dancing and disaster too. Meantime, ageing boxer ""Butch"" (Bruce Willis) is supposed to help the boss by taking an early dive in a fight. Instead he manages to kill his opponent! Soon he is intent on fleeing town, well at least he tries before he and ""Wallace"" end up being the playthings of some interesting characters who keep their own leather-clad gimp locked in a box... It\'s really difficult to make sense of the narrative in writing. It flows really well, but at differing speeds and in several different directions at once. The stories are violent but delivered in an almost tongue-in cheek way. The dance between ""Mia"" and ""Vega"" has become the stuff of cinema legend; there is loads of chemistry - especially between Travolta and an on form Jackson who really does deliver his biblical verses with a puritanical - an lethal - zeal; Willis is as good here as he ever was and you cannot but feel sorry for poor old ""Pumpkin"" (Tim Roth) and his pal ""Honey Bunny"" (Amanda Plummer) whose habit of committing petty robberies when they realise that nobody ever thinks to hit a restaurant, all goes awry. The dialogue is cleverly targeted, with wit and pith but also used sparingly when the first rate soundtrack is allowed to let everyone come up for air. Tarantino himself features towards the end as just about everybody gets their just desserts. This is a classy and sharp piece of enigmatic and enjoyable cinema held together well by a creative and visionary director who appreciates how to get the best of a cast that know how to entertain!'], ['-', ""Tarantino is the most overrated director of our times, all his films are silly but people say they are masterpieces, perhaps they are but not for the right way, the only good thing about Tarantino is that he isn't afraid of revenge for the sake of making his characters good.""], ['100%', 'really fun to watch and the attention to detail is great'], ['60%', 'One of the unavoidable movies to know Tarantino… but I think it\'s not as incredible as it is sometimes said to be.\nThis was one of the films that consolidated Tarantino\'s career and made him one of the ""superstar"" directors who, whenever he releases a film, whether good or bad, attracts a legion to the cinema. I was never a fan of his, and I don\'t think I will be. He made some films that I liked and others that I hated. I wouldn\'t call it regular, a “safe bet”, but we can\'t deny it, it\'s original, true to his style and doesn\'t seem concerned about pleasing anyone.\nThe film follows more than one plot: we have a couple of violent bandits who try to rob a cafeteria, we have a boxer at the end of his career who has to flee after winning a fight he had agreed he would lose, we have a couple of murderers in the pay of a mobster who are tasked with recovering a stolen suitcase, and we also have the capricious girlfriend of that same mobster, whose boredom forces her darling to assign one of his assassins to babysit for her. What unites them all? In addition to the fact that they naturally intersect, they are all part of the same violent, brutal and marginal universe.\nFor many, this film is one of the best of the 90\'s. I would never consider it as such, that is, for me, an exaggeration. It\'s reasonably good, it\'s gained cult status, it has fans, but it\'s not a masterpiece, not for me. It\'s not a boring film, it doesn\'t tire us out and the various sub-plots are intertwined very well, with skill and elegance. There\'s a lot of violence, heavy slang and drugs, and that can be really hard at times, I felt that too. However, this heavier language, drugs and violence end up being a natural part of the underworld of crime and marginality where the characters move, so it\'s something we can count on right from the start. And there are no sympathetic characters who can arouse some empathy, so it doesn\'t matter to us whether they live or die in the most unpleasant ways (and some of them suffer a lot).\nThese are all qualities, and will be even more valued by those who are more familiar with the “pulp” literary subgenre. I\'m not, it\'s not part of my culture, and I even had to go look it up on the Internet to understand what it was, and what its characteristics were. Despite that, there are a few things about this film that I really didn\'t like or felt over the top. One of them is the dialogues. There are scenes with a lot of dialogues, dialogues without any interest, which can dwell on boring topics, just because. One of them, right at the beginning of the film, is about foot massages, just to give a small example. There are many scenes that seem overly drawn out due to these endless dialogues. I also think the film has too many images of bare feet. Tarantino gained fame as a fetishist, but he always said he wasn\'t… watching this film makes it hard to believe him. And one of the characters, who is a murderer, makes a very long quote from the Bible… it\'s the kind of “literature” that I think an underworld murderer probably wouldn\'t know by heart.\nThe actors are very good, we have several notable names: John Travolta is excellent in the role he was given, with that black suit and his hair soaked in oil. Samuel L. Jackson is not far behind, and Uma Thurman is fantastic. I would say that, at least, Thurman and Travolta achieve performances at the best level of their respective careers in this film. Bruce Willis isn\'t bad, but he\'s just not that interesting. I enjoyed seeing my countrywoman Maria de Medeiros in her only major international role, I\'m sorry she couldn\'t go further, but that\'s life. Tarantino also appears in the film, and it would have been much better if he hadn\'t. He\'s a ham as an actor.\nTechnically, the film has many qualities, starting with the excellent cinematography, with vivid colors and good lighting. There are excellent action scenes, for all tastes, and the soundtrack makes good use of several musical themes that we know very well.']]"

Sounds strange I know, but bear with me.\nOn the one hand you have this Super Hero movie, it\'s about the main character, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), flying around doing comic book-character type stuff, and it\'s this pretty okay action film that\'s worth taking a look at. Then, there\'s this drama with a hint of comedy, this other film isn\'t really a genre, it\'s just about the characters interacting with each other, it\'s about the main character, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), driving around doing billionaire-playboy type stuff, and this movie, is fucking great. Part script, and part flawless acting, this movie sets Iron Man 2 apart from any other Super Hero film out there. It was explored in the first film, and you get a similar thing there, but in this movie the division is more clear, and it bizarrely benefits from it.\nWhen films go franchise-style, it\'s inevitable that there will be scheduling conflicts, it\'s an unfortunate part of the industry, particularly when you have a deadline to meet, and for whatever reason, an actor will be unable to return to their original role. Such an event takes place in Iron Man 2 when Lt. Col. James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (originally played by Terrance Howard) is replaced by Don Cheadle. I personally think that Howard was better suited to the role, simply because he looks more like Rhodey does in the comics. But their way of dealing with the changeover is simple, and clever, the character\'s first lines, whilst making perfect sense in context, are ""Look, it\'s me, I\'m here, deal with it. Let\'s move on. Drop it."" Very classy.\nAlthough Mickey Rourke (Get Carter, Sin City, The Wrestler, Man on Fire, The Expendables) manages a very convincing evil Russian; Ivan Vanko, who\'s a perfectly good character, Whiplash as a villain is unfortunately somewhat lacking. Sam Rockwell (The Green Mile, The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Frost/Nixon, Moon, Conviction) plays Justin Hammer, corporate rival of Stark\'s. Scarlett Johansen (Eight Legged Freaks, The Girl with a Pearl Earring, The Island, The Prestige, The Spirit) is another good addition to the cast, in the role of Natalie Rushman A.K.A Natasha Romanoff A.K.A Black Widow. Samuel L. Jackson (Jurassic Park, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, The Starwars Prequel Trilogy, Shaft, S.W.A.T, Kill Bill Volume 2, Snakes on a Plane, 1408, The Spirit, Inglourious Basterds) portraying S.H.I.E.L.D Director Nick Fury, rounds out the newbies in the cast. And it\'s all good news.\nThe Hammerdrones are an attempt at revamping the whole boss-battle that was such a let down in the original film, which honestly, once again didn\'t really work out. Once again it\'s a case of the character interaction that makes the film what it is. The effects also went a long way in the line of helping out the film, \'cause they were awesome. There are a couple of negatives in the script, just those moments when the suspension of disbelief is not... suspend-y enough. As for example the line; ""Congratulations sir, you have created a new element"", is a little flawed.\nThough if I was forced to choose between them, I would probably say that Iron Man is the better of the two films, but Iron Man 2 has a better re-watch value in my opinion, which I prize highly.

Scarlett Johansson is also a solid addition, though Sam Rockwell didn't do anything for me in his role. Mickey Rourke is fun enough as Ivan.""], ['70%', ""A predictable sequel that continues the story of the first film without, however, being as good as it is.\nAfter an excellent first movie, this was a predictable sequel, but I have to admit that the movie is a bit over the top and that, sometimes, it feels like a very expensive video game. Furthermore, the main character, Tony Stark, is perhaps one of the nastiest and most irritating comic heroes, and this movie seems to try to accentuate that by turning the protagonist into a spoiled playboy who has expensive toys and looks at women like if they were, also, toys. Okay, I know the character was also portrayed like that in the original books, even though I'm not a comics fan. But the movie could give something that made Tony Stark someone we could really care about.\nIn this film, the hero will face his first great antagonist, the son of a Soviet scientist that Stark's father knew. At the same time, Stark has to face the US Army, who are eager to get their hands on the combat suits he created, discovering that his father knew of a new chemical element, not yet officially discovered, and in which lies the key for the survival of Stark himself. With these brief lines, we can see, right away, that the script is not exactly one of the strong points of the film. The feeling that remains is that the script shoots in several directions, trying to create a more complex story, but that something got in the way and prevented that objective.\nThe cast basically has the same names as the previous film. Robert Downey Jr. is back to the red armor for yet another film, where he has shown himself to be deftly sarcastic and irritating without losing his heroic pose. Mickey Rourke is a welcome addition to the cast, playing the villain. The actor was able to adapt to the character quite competently. Samuel L. Jackson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle also return, but they don't do more than they did in the previous film, still fulfilling what was asked of them. Scarlett Johansson deserves a praise for her work here, but the rest of the cast just do what needs to be done.\nThe film is yet another very expensive blockbuster, abundantly financed by Marvel, and it is very obvious that it will become one of the most watched films of the season. With so much money and financial interest involved, the film was doomed to a loud and flashy bet on high-quality, but still obviously false, effects and CGI. The film has a lot of action and the fights are excellent, although obviously choreographed and stilted. The cinematography is crisp, vibrant, and magnificently beautiful.

Though the film looks good, and there are plenty of action scenes with pyrotechnics and airborne antics, the scenarios recycle themselves once to often. There is no jeopardy, and both Rockwell and Rourke really just substitute excessive ham for menace. Most of the originality and humour of the first film has been lost, indeed this is just a bit relentless and actually quite dull.

It is far from great, certainly very far from the insane hype surrounding it, but pretty okay. It is more or less a standard issue super hero movie on a big budget. Of course this means a fairly mediocre underlying story beefed up with lots of action and special effects.\nThe story itself is a traditional revenge story with some black power stuff.

The fight scenes were relatively well-choreographed, as well. The ritual combat scenes were exciting and visually appealing. The fights in Korea were also fun to see, and while I'm not a fan of car chase scenes as a whole, I did enjoy this one.

Everything seemed crammed together with major emotional keys being rushed through or somewhat ignored. The concept is fine though. A long lost relative comes to challenge the new king, wins, and shows his colors, becoming something amoral. The king comes back and takes down the usurper, realizing something about themselves/their kingdom in the process. It's tired, but not so tired it damages the movie.\nThis is where the issues begin to rise, though. The movie is really a movie and a half or two movies crammed into one.

Unfortunately, T’Challa’s reign is challenged by an angry American former-black ops soldier, Erik “Killmonger” (Michael B.

Critics were apparently afraid of being called “racist” by liberal fascists if they dared to be honest and say anything negative (rolling my eyes). The movie’s likable and certainly has its points of interest, but the characters are rather dull, except for Killmonger, and the story isn’t all that involving. It’s basically a mediocre superhero movie that has some blatant Bond-isms and is set apart by its primarily black cast and African locale. It fails to rise to the entertainment level of even “Ant-Man” (2015).\nStill, it’s respectfully noble and the story provokes interesting questions, like isolationism vs. internationalism and African-American culture vs. Native African culture.

This issue was the beginning of the ""Panther\'s Rage"" storyline by Don McGregor (featuring artists Billy Graham, Rich Buckler and Gil Kane), which ran for over two years in 13 issues of Jungle Action #6-18 and 209 pages, including the Epilogue. Many consider it the first graphic novel. Of course, this wasn\'t the first appearance of the Black Panther (who debuted in 1966), but it was the first issue where he was the starring character.\nAnd it was this series that provided the intriguing exposition on T’Challa, Wakanda and its citizens, visitors & enemies. It’s a travesty that McGregor, who created the characters of Killmonger & W’Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) and conceived this exposition, wasn’t acknowledged in this movie; shameful.\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 14 minutes and was shot in Georgia (Atlanta, Fayetteville), South Korea (Busan) and Iguazú Waterfalls, Argentina.

I am not going to spoil the plot for you, but I bet you can foresee most developments, dear reader.\nOverall I have mixed feelings. The story is nothing new, most elements are well known for this kind of movie. Some decisions of characters (including the dragon) feel dumb, and sometimes our main character gets very lucky, so the rest of the plot can happen. The CGI ranges from poor to pretty good, poor more in the begging, with huge landscapes and castles, but later, when the dragon makes an appearance, it looks pretty decent. But I was watching on a rather small screen and Netflix is punishing me with mediocre quality for some time now. So take my visual rating with a grain of salt. Now one thing I will say about the dragon: It has an interesting spin to it. For one thing, half of the time, we do not really see it and only hear Shohreh Aghdashloo's deep, rasping voice, bringing it to life. And when we actually see the dragon, it has a slight horror touch if you will. It looks like a hybrid between your average majestic and broadly loved dragon and something more dark and slimy. A muskrat comes to mind. I liked that (sort of).\nOne remark towards the title: While it is obviously a play the well known 'Damsel in distress' and obviously Elodie fights instead of needing to be rescued, she screams a lot and actually seems in distress half of the film. Until she suddenly becomes the hero and single-handedly fights the dragon. It is a bit much and hard to believe.\nThis is in all honesty an average movie. It is neither terrible nor great. If you are in the mood for some imagery, gold and jewels, dragons, princesses, and a few swords, then go for it. There are worse ways to spend roughly 109 minutes.

Set in a medieval world, it follows Elodie, played by Millie Bobby Brown, who is tricked into a marriage with a prince only to find out she\'s to be sacrificed to a dragon as part of a centuries-old pact. The film takes a turn from fairy tale to survival as Elodie uses her wit and resources to escape her fate.\nThemes:\nThe film explores themes of self-reliance, empowerment, and the subversion of traditional gender roles. It challenges the narrative of the passive female character, presenting a heroine who is capable and resourceful.\nCharacter Development:\nElodie\'s character arc is central to the film\'s impact. She evolves from a young woman resigned to her fate to a fierce survivor, fighting not just for herself but for the future of her people. The supporting characters, including the prince and the queen, add depth to the story, each revealing their own motives and complexities.\nDirector\'s Style:\nJuan Carlos Fresnadillo directs with a clear vision, blending action with fantasy elements. His use of contrasting settings – from the snowy village to the opulent royal court – adds to the film\'s visual appeal.\nPerformances:\nMillie Bobby Brown delivers a strong performance, capturing Elodie\'s transformation convincingly. The supporting cast, including Ray Winstone and Robin Wright, provide solid performances, though Angela Bassett\'s talent is noted as underused.\nTechnical Aspects:\nThe film boasts impressive production design and costumes, creating a visually stunning medieval world. However, some reviews criticize the CGI as cheap-looking and the action sequences as repetitive.\nStrengths and Weaknesses:\nStrengths include the film\'s strong lead performance, innovative plot, and beautiful set pieces. Weaknesses lie in the script and some performances that fail to engage, along with technical aspects that could have been executed better.\nRecommendation:\n""Damsel"" is a film that offers a fresh take on the fantasy genre. While it has its flaws, the film\'s strengths make it worth watching for those interested in a modern twist on classic fairy tales.\nIn conclusion, ""Damsel"" is a bold attempt to redefine a genre steeped in tradition. It\'s a film that will resonate with audiences looking for strong female leads and a story that champions individual agency over destiny. Despite its shortcomings, ""Damsel"" is a commendable addition to the fantasy genre and is recommended for its unique perspective and engaging storyline.'], ['50%', 'A disappointment.\n\'Damsel\' has the right ingredients but unfortunately fails to deliver.

Thus it was filmed on 70 mm film and in 6 channel stereo which, at the time was a huge thing.

I thought come on, where’s the adventure, not to mention any form of action? Today I can more appreciate it for what it is. A visually stunning movie. I also can more appreciate the fact that the movie is trying to be scientifically accurate instead of going all out on the fiction part.

I also noticed now, when re-watching it, that all the screens are actually flat which also was really far in the future at the time. Actually it was still pretty much in the future back in 2001.\nHowever, even today, I have to say that I find the movie excruciatingly boring. It is two and a half hour long and it moves very, very slowly. It takes 50 minutes of movie time before we actually get to the main part of the movie and get onto the Discovery for instance.

I know that the director's fans are going to crucify me, but that's how I think, and I even say more: with each Kubrick film I see, I am more convinced that an aura of unjustified “cult” genius has been created around him. I loved some of his movies like “Spartacus”, “Dr. Strangelove”, “Shining” and “Eyes Wide Shut”, but thinking about them and trying to compare them with “Clockwork Orange” and “Full Metal Jacket” is strange. They don't look like the work of the same director.\nReleased in the 1960s, at a time when the space race was at its height and when the future of Humanity seemed, more and more, to be outside our planet, the film addresses the question of the evolution of the human species in a “sui generis” way: it starts with monkeys and goes to the first contacts with extraterrestrial beings. The film was considered one of the defining milestones of sci-fi as a cinematographic genre, and I believe that this is indisputable. It's also one of the rare sci-fi movies that seems concerned with being scientifically credible, yet not without flaws that a good scientist will spot (and we might not).\nSet in a hypothetical future, the film shows what space explorations and life in colonies made in space and on the Moon would be like. However, it is still ironic that, after the 60s and 70s, space exploration has been so secondary that many questions, even today, whether we really should spend industrial amounts of money and resources on it. The future that Kubrick imagined in 2001 seems, in 2022, even more imaginative and far from happening than when the film was released. However, some things really did happen and are, today, normal: this is the case of video calls and the extraordinary advances in robotics and artificial intelligence.\nAmong the various merits of this film, we have to highlight the extraordinary visual beauty, the way the director worked with the visual and special effects and the excellent camera work. At a time when CGI was a mirage far from a filmmaker's mind, this film gives us images and visuals that look like they were made this year. The film simply hasn't aged a single day: we have clear images, magnificently crafted light and details, excellent sound effects, a cinematography that makes envy to many 21st century films and, also important, a magnificent soundtrack where “Blue Danube” and “Also Sprach Zarathustra” stand out, helping to popularize these melodies.\nDespite these indisputable merits, I think this film deserves to be on the list of the most overrated films I've ever seen. And this is due, in good part, to everything else that I didn't say, and which is essential in a good film. Let's start with the absence of a script and horrible pace: for almost three hours, the film drags on unbearably in scenes of great beauty, but with nothing to say. It's truly exasperating. The only moments where the film really gains interest are when the ship's supercomputer turns against the astronauts, and even that segment feels loose, as if the script were a patchwork quilt. The allusions to aliens didn't fascinate me either, it's a regular cliché when making a movie set in space. One point that also didn't help is the lack of good actors, or any decent work for them to do, and the fact that Kubrick shows us life on the space stations as if it were a stay in a luxury hotel. And what about the extraordinary sense of arrogant conceit that the film conveys? We are the ones who have to recognize if the film is good, it can't be the film telling us that every minute!""], ['-', 'From the opening bars of Richard Strauss\'s ""Also spracht Zarathustra"" you just know that this is going to be something unique - and that it is.

The animal-based Maximals are able to escape with the key and hide it on Earth where they will also remain in secret as guardians.\nFlash forward to 1994 when Noah Diaz (Anthony Ramos), following his stint in the Army is looking to find gainful employment to help his mother as well as his ailing brother.\xa0 Despite being a wizard with electronics Noah is not considered to be a team player which has hampered his job prospects and leads him to consider criminal activities in an effort to obtain much-needed funds for his brother\'s medical bills.\nIn a moment of desperation, Noah attempts to steal a loaded Porsche but finds he is unable to follow through on the act as it is against his moral compass.\xa0 Unknown to Noah the car is actually an Autobot named Mirage (Pete Davidson), who soon enlists Noah to help them find the key which they have recently detected.\nThis does not sit well with Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), who believes that humanity will only act in your best interests and that his crew needs to find the key so that they can return to their war-ravaged, Cybertron.\nIt is learned that a crafty but perpetually overlooked museum intern named Elena (Dominique Fishback), has accidentally activated the key and in doing so has allowed the evil Scourge (Peter Dinklage), and his minions to zero in on its location as he attempts to obtain the key for his master and is willing to destroy all were in his way.\nNoah and Elena soon find themselves paired with their unexpected allies as they race to stop the evil from obtaining both parts of the key and find themselves with some unexpected allies in the form of the Maximals.\nWhat follows is a frantic action-adventure film that cleverly combines humor, action, dazzling visual effects, and a tail that is part Indiana Jones, and Transformers with a surprising amount of humanity.\nIt would be easy for the human cast the overshadowed by the massive and visually spectacular creations that frequently transform and battle it out across numerous action sequences.\xa0 However, director Steven Caple Jr. takes advantage of his young talent both of whom are clearly potential stars in the making as they provide a grounding humanity to the film which makes it more than a lavish FX showcase.\nThe film also has an impressive era-specific soundtrack and a scene near the end that offers up some intriguing and exciting possibilities for the future. ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" is a highly enjoyable summer action adventure as well as one the more enjoyable films in the franchise and should delight fans of the franchise and has me for the first time in a long time eagerly awaiting what comes next.\n4 stars out of 5'], ['20%', 'Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is a pointless entry in the live-action Transformers film franchise.

Now that\'s not really saying much, most of them are pretty poor, but somehow the shamelessly derivative nature of this just made it more entertaining. It all starts with ""Optimus Primal"" (aka. ""Kingus Kongus"") having a fight with the all-consuming ""Unicron"" (narked because a typo robbed him of his chance to just be an horse with an horn) for a key that can open portals between worlds enabling the baddie to quite literally eat them and move on. The solution to that battle is a bit of a compromise and scoot forward hundreds of year and New Yorker ""Noah"" (Anthony Ramos) has a problem. His younger brother ""Kris"" (Dean Scott Vasquez) is very poorly and they cannot afford his medical bills. ""Noah"" turns to crime and that\'s where he encounters the newly invigorated ""Autobots"" who have realised that ""Elena"" (Dominique Fishback) - a researcher in a museum - has rediscovered the hidden key. They have to retrieve it before it falls into more malevolent hands. Soon the two hapless humans and their robots are engaged in a battle royal that sees the museum pretty much trashed before they head to Peru where they encounter the ""Maximals"" and the beautiful Inca terraces are soon for the chop too. So far I reckon we\'ve been through loads of episodes of ""Stargate"" as well ""King Kong"" (probably the Peter Jackson one), ""The Goblet of Fire""; ""Independence Day"", ""Star Trek"" (JJ Abrams version), all four ""Indiana Jones"" films - which, to be fair are even acknowledged in the script, and the armoured eagle ""Airazor"" reminded me of a hairier version of ""Bubo"" from ""Clash of the Titans"". The visuals are excellent and for the most part it\'s got plenty of action but as we near the ever-so-predictable denouement the pace slackens off and cheesy sentiment brings the thing to a grinding halt a couple of times! There\'s no jeopardy at all, really, and given that ""Optimus Prime"" - maybe he ought to be called ""Hopeless Prime"" because he is pretty useless in a fight - gets to make his grand speech at the end, I\'m sure there will be more for our intrepid young ""Noah"" to come.

Rise of the Beasts establishes some decent human leads that aren’t annoying while keeping the focus on the robot conflict. The voice cast was fantastic! Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime will always be the greatest of all time. Peter Dinklage’s Scourge sounds and looks vicious. Ron Perlman, Michelle Yeoh, Pete Davidson, and Cristo Fernández provide solid performances, giving their characters a little fun and even some heart. Rise of the Beasts reels the franchise back in from the outrageous goofiness of the Wahlberg entries but still has a good time recognizing its primary audience is kids and parents who grew up on the cartoon. The intensity and pacing of the first 2 acts are superb! The final act gets a little cheesy and starts to feel generic, but it is no worse than the climax of recent Marvel films. Rise of the Beasts isn’t perfect but it sets the Transformers back on the right path.'], ['60%', 'Quite a while since I watched the last Transformers movie. About five years. I cannot say that I had really high expectations for this one. A Transformers movie is a movie you watch almost entirely for the special effects after all.\nIt is an okayish movie but I have to say that I was less impressed with this one than with the previous ones.\nIt is clearly a movie directed to a somewhat younger audience. Still at times it was a bit cringeworthy. Especially the small “speeches” from Optimus Prime. I know it is a PG-13 movie but I think Hollywood underestimates the intelligence of young adults. But then, given the political bias Hollywood has these days maybe it is not surprising that they expect below average intelligence.\nStill, there were some cool special effects, a lot of Transformer fights and such like stuff making the movie not feel like a complete waste of time.\nThe story is of course on the thin side and the title of the movie is misleading hyperbole. Yes, the beast Transformers are introduced but I would hardly call it “rise” . Just a few more Transformers stranded on Earth.\nOne thing I didn’t much like was the appearance of Optimus Prime. He looked like a has-been bum with his shabby truck and shabby appearance when not in his truck mode. Optimus Primal was much more cool.\nAs I wrote, overall a watchable movie but nothing really to write home about.\nOh, by they way. Remember that useless woke far left tomato site? On the page for the movie the “critical consensus” says “Thanks to some genuine human drama between the set pieces and palpable affection for the title characters, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is one of the franchise’s more enjoyable outings.” and then they put a rotten tomato side by side and claims the movie is rotten.

And that title is ""The Imperial March"", composed by the great John Williams, whom, as many of you may already know, also composed the theme music for ""Jaws"" - that legendary score simply titled, ""Main Title (Theme From Jaws)"".\nNow, with that lil\' bit of trivia aside, let us procede with the fabled film currently under review: Star Wars. It had been at a drive-in theater in some small Illinois town or other where my mother, my older brother, and I had spent our weekly ""Movie Date Night"" watching this George Lucas directed cult masterpiece from our car in the parking lot. On the huge outdoor screen, the film appeared to be a silent one, but thanks to an old wire-attached speaker, we were able to hear both the character dialogue and soundtrack loud and clear. We even had ourselves a carful of vittles and snacks - walked back to our vehicle, of course, from the wide-opened cinema\'s briefly distant concession stand. Indeed, it had been a lovely summer evening that July.\nFrom the time the film started, with my brother and I following along as our mother sped-read the opening crawl, I began to feel rather antsy, thinking that this movie, the first in a franchise that would soon be world-renowned, was going to be boring, due to its genre being Science Fiction: A respectably likable, but not a passionately lovable genre of mine DURING THAT TIME. I just didn\'t believe I was going to like Star Wars all that much ... But I soon found myself intrigued ... And awed.\nGeorge Lucas is a man with a phenomenal, and I do mean phenomenal imagination. Apart from his human characters (Han, Luke, Leia, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, among others), the droids: C-3P0, R2-D2, R2-series, and IG-88, not to mention those unusual characters like Jabba the Hutt, Yoda, and Chewbacca, just to name a few, are all creations of Lucas\'s phenomenal imagination. And I was completely in awe of each one of these strange beings. Then there was Vader ... And the evil Emperor ... And the Stormtroopers ... And the Spacecraft ... And the galaxies (I\'ll admit that I am a huge lover of the Universe in all its Celestial glory) ... And the magnificent planets ... The Lightsabers ... And so on. Star Wars is a gorgeously shot space opera; it is truly an epic masterpiece. We enjoyed this film tremendously. And my brother was a die-hard fan from that night onward. He, my brother, had even received for Christmas that year, nearly every Star Wars action figure that my mother could find, including two of the spacecraft: The Millennium Falcon and Star Destroyer. The Death Star space station had too been wrapped beneath our Christmas tree - tagged with his name. It was totally crazy, what the new Star Wars era. Frenzied! But it was great ... Even still, to this day.\nI don\'t personally know anyone whom has yet to see Star Wars, but that certainly doesn\'t suggest there are still a few people out there who haven\'t. And if you\'re one of the latter, then you should know that this classic space opera comes highly recommended. The entire series is told backwards, so you\'ll definitely want to see Star Wars first, followed by its two sequels: The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi ... In that order. I trust that you\'ll too discover yourself to be a lifelong cult fan in the wake. 😊'], ['100%', 'A long time ago in a childhood not too far away...\nPrincess Leia is captured and held hostage by the Imperial Army as it seeks to rule the Galactic Empire. An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi may just be hers, and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and all who dwell within it.\nBack in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old boy, weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents, I had no idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers previously, where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly cemented, Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very day.\nAs the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken on more in-depth and serious tones, I have come to realise that Star Wars proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus evil axis, while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands, but really do those things matter? No they do not, because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema, something of a portal to youngsters such as I, it got people talking and debating about the merits of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here), it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach, and crucially, above all else, it got film goers hungry again, a hankering for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th Century Fox\'s historic blockbuster didn\'t run with the baton, in fact most pale into comparison on impact value, but for better or worse (depending on the discerning viewers peccadilloes), Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure laden entertainment.\nIt is by definition one of the most successful films in history, George Lucas perhaps didn\'t know it at the time, but in what was to become an almost operatic anthology, he didn\'t just make a movie, he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as amazing as the success of the series, is how it has become part of modern day pop culture, anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time or another referenced Lucas\' baby. Ultimately, though, it\'s one single thing that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great, it\'s that it has the ability to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event to watch in the theatre, now here in my middle age it\'s an event that is like hugging a dear old friend, a friend that I know will never ever let me down no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10'], ['100%', 'Star Wars (1977) is a true masterpiece of cinema, and is \n  definitely one of the best films ever made.\nFor me Star Wars (1977) is the best movie of all time,tied with The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Leaving aside the magnificent special effects; this is a film about good and evil; empire, freedom and democracy and of their true characterisations.

My favorite scene is when he lays in bed next to Adrian with the sudden realization that he cannot win this fight. It was an incredibly vulnerable moment for him and worked really well.\nAs I said before, the dialogue is very inconsistent, especially in the scene at Rocky's house with Adrian. It was very unsettling to watch because she is written as if she does not want to be there, but then the next second she is in love with him. It was very weird and creepy.

What follows is a solid, engaging tale of grit and determination as the champion assumes it\'s all in the bag and together with his tight-knit team, the challenger is focussed and determined to, at least, go the distance. Sure, Stallone isn\'t an actor in any traditional sense - he is more of a character, he oozes the part rather then portrays it - and that is what makes this work. You are subsumed into his life, his love, his training and his ambition - almost as the then aspiring Stallone would have been whilst writing and making the film. The action scenes are first class, and the charisma offered by the star, and by trainer Meredith help this stand the test of time well. There are holes in the plot - but they are fairly easy to overlook if you allow the sentiment and strong performances to take and keep hold of your imagination. Great stuff.']]"

His relationship with Gwen is developed extensively here, and they’re a great onscreen duo.\nThe film is computer-animated, and the visuals are nothing short of masterful. The animation is vibrant, skillfully executed, and absolutely stunning. This is the type of visual art that leaves your eyes begging for more. From the attention to detail to the choice of hues, there isn’t one misstep to be found.\nThe story, however, has a few stumbles, and most of that stems from the overly long run time (2 hours, 20 minutes), the too-insider Easter egg references for diehard comic fans, and the irritating cliffhanger ending that is so obnoxious that it almost ruins everything that came before. Thank goodness the rest of the movie is so much fun.\n“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” is the type of film that proves animation isn’t just for kids, and it’s certainly not a throwaway medium that deserves to be dismissed. It’s an action-packed, visually dazzling, frentic, and outrageously fun piece of cinema.

Venom doesnt quite know what it is. It cant decide wether its a goofy, action or a horror movie. Therefore its all of it and none at the same time.\nThe goofy jokes are pretty lame, which is why they are funny, you dont laugh with the writers, you laugh at them.\nThe action scenes are meh at best, \ncar chase : check\nmotorcycle : check\nridiculous (bad) cgi fight: check\nsure, watching Tom Hardy motorcross in San Francisco is quite fun, but its not really action.\nFinally, the horror; there are glimpses, glimmers of hope scattered around this movie. Little snippets of what could have been, but as soon as they appear they disappear.\nTwo scenes really stood out to me due to their potential. After quite a lot of buildup of Venom getting into the building (BY RUNNING UP IT), Eddie decides to take the lift down. Instead of having Eddie walk into the SWAT team, they should have been swarming the building crawling through the floors looking for him. Then, they could have had an ALIEN like hunting scene where Venom slowly takes out the task force one by one, in true horror movie fashion.\nThe other obvious horror scene could have been using the creepy little girl that delivers RIOT to the Musk wannabe, they could have homaged The Shining, they could have pulled an exorcist, they could have done a million things, but the little girl just has white pupils and a deep voice.\nThroughout the movie there are just continuous disappointments because you see what it is missing.\nInstead of the cheap love story and all the stupid overdone things they should have been ballsy with their movie. Yes the movie DID make 800+ million, however im sure it was going to do that anyway. Venom is probably one of the most badass characters in comic history, and Tom Hardy is Tom Hardy.\nI would have loved to see something along these lines:\nSymbiote hunts Eddie. \nSymbiote captures Eddie and they become Venom.\nVenom starts unleashing hell because he can, hunts SWAT etc. \nVenom goes after Musk wannabe and Kills him.\nThrow some more horror elements in there, and it would have made for a much more satisfactory watch. I have always adored Venom, and this movie had so much potential, but it was all for nothing. No rewatchability. Nothing worth remembering. Just a flick.\nIt was funny seeing Tom Hardy being a bit of a pussball, but even he cant help a crap script and an even worse film.'], ['70%', 'It’s school holidays here in France which means the kids are at my place which in turn means lot’s of time in front of the screen. Last night it was Venom’s turn to be plopped into my Blu-ray player.\nI have to say that I was a little disappointed. Sure it is a good movie and I did indeed enjoy it but not as much as I thought I would. According to the ratings it looked like the majority of the audience liked it a lot and I do like the character Venom. Sure the culture elite and politically correct idiots that Rotten Tomates use as “critics” claimed it to be rotten but, for me, that’s usually a good sign when it comes to my entertainment value from a movie.\nThe good things are that I found Venom, the creature, really cool. I liked his voice, his appearance and his no-nonsense attitude. The special effects and the action was very enjoyable to watch. Luckily that was my main reason for watching the movie. Actually, it is probably the main reason I want to watch any Marvel movie, especially lately given the poor quality of writers that Marvel has employed.\nI guess it is a plus as well that there was not too much politically correct, green or social preaching in it. I am sure those so inclined can find more than me if they go looking for it but most of the movie audience, at least not for this type of movie, probably could not care less.\nThe main reason I felt somewhat disappointed is that the main protagonist is really not someone I could feel like I would root for. He is such a despicable douche-bag. For starters he is a low life journalist with an overblown ego and disrespect of pretty much everything. The kind CNN would employ. Even when he’s been infected by Venom he continues between being a worthless egoistic coward and just an asshole. Actually the only real difference between the him and the big bad guy is that the bad guy is a hundred times more intelligent. It’s not until the very end scenes that Eddie develops a minimum of likability.\nOn the other hand Venom is really the star of the movie. Both as a “thing” and as a character. He is a real bad-ass, quite funny and really everything that Eddie should have been as a character. He even develops more as a character than previously mentioned douche-bag.\nIt’s a shame since otherwise this would have been a great movie. The story is simple but works well for this kind of movie. There are no silly twists and convoluted sub-plots. The main protagonist, as poor as he is, at least do not carry a lot of past history trying to explain God knows what and such stuff.\nIf the character of the main protagonist would have been more likable this would have been a great movie.

Maggie Gyllenhaal plays his sister, Holmes Osborne & Mary McDonnell his parents, Drew Barrymore his teacher, Katharine Ross his therapist, Jena Malone his girlfriend, Noah Wyle his science teacher and Patrick Swayze a self-help guru. Patience Cleveland is on hand as Grandma Death.\nWhile the movie flopped at the box office, it has since become a serious cult hit. I saw it recently for the first time and went into it cold without knowing anything about the intricacies behind the plot. The only thing I knew was that the kid was harassed by an ee-vil bunny apparition. The film mildly works as a high school drama with a satirical smirk. But the story\'s just not engaging enough on that level. While the movie has some quality women, it fails to capitalize on their presence (Barrymore, for instance, is barely in it). But Jake is a solid protagonist, even somewhat sympathetic despite the curious things he does.\nBy the middle of the second act I found myself getting bored with the story and trying to figure out what was going on, but the film perks up in the last act, particularly when it reveals the truth about the scary bunny guy. After viewing, my overall impression was that the story never really took off and was burdened by perplexing ambiguities even while possessing some fascinating elements. I came up with a theory to explain the events (explained below) but, upon reflection, I realized that all the pieces didn\'t fit. And the movie simply wasn\'t entertaining enough to bang my head further trying to figure it out. I would\'ve given the movie a mediocre 5/10 rating, but after investigating the official meaning and the alternative explanations I had to admit that the film is genius in this respect. It just needed to be attached to a more interesting story with more stimulating characters.\nThe film runs 113 minutes, which is the version I saw; the Director\'s Cut runs 20 minutes longer.

But, as noted above, there are too many holes in this interpretation.\nA couple of other popular explanations are the banal Schizophrenia Theory, where the film shows the protagonist going through an episode of his illness, and the Dream Theory, where it was ""all just a dream,"" which is too clichéd and idiotic to even consider.\nThe \'official\' interpretation I would\'ve never pieced together because it\'s just too sci-fi-oriented and complex: It\'s the Tangent Universe Theory, which suggests that time in the Primary Universe (i.e. reality) is occasionally corrupted and an unstable alternative universe is created, but it will only last a few weeks. Nevertheless, it threatens to destroy the universe. The events you see happening in the bulk of the film are this alternative reality where the universe (or God) is correcting the error to get back to the Primary Universe using an Artifact (the jet engine), The Living Receiver (Jake Gyllenhaal), a Manipulated Dead person (the bunny guy), and so on. Google it and you\'ll see that the Tangent Universe explanation ties up all the loose ends.'], ['90%', 'A complete mind-bender of a movie that put Jake Gyllenhall on the map, introduced the creepiest rabbit costume of all time, and may make you surprisingly tear up to a remake of Tears for Fears ""Mad World.""'], ['60%', ""A strange film, with a strong visual impact and a script with wild theories, but which fulfills its objective very well and is enjoyable to watch.\nI saw this film very recently, and I have to agree with all those who label it “strange” or “bizarre”. Directed and written by Richard Kelly, it stars a young Jake Gyllenhaal and offers us a very complex plot where a young teenager commits several crimes under the influence of an imaginary friend who dresses up as a rabbit. Everything indicates that this young man is schizophrenic or psychotic in some way, and has developed several linked obsessions, but the film always leaves us in doubt as to whether he is, in some way, right about the things he thinks.\nThere are several films that follow similar scripts, where imagination and psychopathy are almost indistinguishable from reality (“Fight Club”, “Machinist”, etc.) and this is perhaps one of the most surreal because it allows us to see, from the beginning, that something is very wrong. That's a bonus for those who like these types of films because it's easy to keep our attention. Of course, those who are less fond of cinematic oddities won't have much reason to be satisfied.\nAnd if it is true that, on a technical level, the film does not present any major innovations or surprises, it is also true that it does everything very correctly and without problems or gross errors. We can even say that, considering the budget, it is one of those films that seems more expensive than it is. In addition, we must also mention the beautiful performance of the cast, where each one seems to do what needs to be done with correctness and restraint.

However the plan to stretch out these topics into 3 or 4 movies should be met with some skepticism.\nEspecially considering the basis for this was started by Damon Lindeloff, the creator of Lost and the man most of us are still waiting for answers for most of the things that happened on Lost.\nHe of course has abandoned this second movie, leaving it in the hands of the far more capable John Logan, but even he struggles to find meaning here, or escape the clichés that have started to grow like a Xenomorph in John Hurt\'s stomach.\nWe\'re dealing with a whole new crew this time; the Covenant. They are headed on a colonial mission to another planet before an electric shock takes out the ship, the Captain, and 47 other members.\nReluctant to get back into their pods for a 7 year journey, the on board crew responsible for the ship\'s upkeep decide instead to answer a distress transmission coming from another planet.\nThat\'s where they find what continues to be the best character in these prequels; Michael Fassbender\'s David the Android. His motivations and whether he considers himself human or God is constantly in question and Fassbender\'s soft-spoken performance continues to haunt.\nI also really do consider Prometheus to be one of the most gorgeous-looking special films of the last decade and this continues that- from the Covenant ship to the grain fields and other vegetation eerily covering the mostly desolate other terrain of the planet.\nWe also get the first look at the Neo-morph, who is born the same way, seems a bit faster than the Xeno-morph but the main differences are it doesn\'t have the Venus fly trap tongue and it can stand like a human. Pretty cool.\nJust it\'s at this point I should probably say that after Aliens there started to be less reason to want these. Alien 3 was fine, Prometheus I thought could really go either way depending on the sequels, and Alien 4 of course was garbage.\nThe biggest problem here is that it feels so redundant. We get a distress call, the crew investigates, some background characters do stupid things leading to impregnation, someone says ""we never should have come"", final alien chase.\nThe aliens, when you can see them, are cool, but there is a lot of downtime between them, and a few quality kills does not a 200 million dollar mega blockbuster make.\nIt\'s also really odd that Prometheus does this whole thing of setting up the engineers as the creators of human beings but here they only get one scene and let\'s just say those looking for more info about them will get angry.\nThe promise of some larger conversation is in here somewhere but these movies feel so stretched out at this point that when this does get to the few moments of actually having something to say, it\'s hard to get re-engaged.\nThe characters don\'t help either as most just come off like archetypes. Katherine Waterston is the Captain\'s widow and really the bargain basement Ellen Ripley here.\nBilly Crudup plays the faith-based character, and like the last movie, this movie seems to be including that without ever really giving it value in the meaning of life conversation.\nBut at least those two have some background. I\'m so tired of most of these others. The ones who just go tramping through the woods of an unknown planet or show the decision making skills of the Trump administration.

The android Walter and how he was portrayed also blends the style of android we see in Aliens. The actor's voice and demeanor reflect that of the android Bishop and gives us a bridge to his design. Michael Fassbender really did one hell of a job acting those two parts of Walter and David.

In the story, the professionals of industrial espionage, using special techniques to steal valuable secrets from the depths of the subconscious during sleep, when the human mind is most vulnerable, learn a new technique - the ‘inception’ of ideas into the human mind through his dream. The main character - Dom Cobb is a talented thief, his rare abilities made him a truly valuable player in the treacherous world of espionage, but they also turned him into a perennial fugitive and stripped him of everything he had ever loved. One day Cobb has a chance to correct mistakes. His latest case can bring everything back, but for that he needs to do the impossible - inception.\nThere are so many good things about the film. The plot of the film is definitely mind-blowing. You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. The soundtrack is written by Hans Zimmer, who is certainly one of the most sought-after composers. I think all his music is incredibly touching, dramatic and powerful. There are also some iconic songs we all know. The work on the special effects is done flawlessly, evidently, a lot of money was spent on this. The acting is also wonderful, Leo DiCaprio, who was the first actor to accept the offer to play in the film, has done an amazing job.\nThe only thing that viewers can find bad about this film is that it can be extremely difficult to perceive. If you don’t watch the film close enough you can simply get lost in all these jumping from dreams to reality.\nA curious fact is that Christopher Nolan released the film in 2010 but started working on it at the beginning of the 2000s!

Nowadays there are lots of altered versions coming that you won't easily say those are the remakes or reboots or spin- offs or whatever they call them in these days. Like 'Premotheus' to 'Alien', this film can remind you a few titles from the past, but 'Contact' is what the majority of us believes it got inspired.\nThe eight Oscars nominees for the film is insane. I know some people liked it, and the film was good, that does not mean it is an Oscar product. I'm okay with the technical side recognition as it deserved that. So visually it was very good, but not a special effects extravaganza. Just a simple sci-fi drama, with a few thrills, particularly towards the end.\nWhen the unexpected visitors from the outer-space land their ships in the twelve different locations on the earth, the humans patiently try to communicate with them to learn their intentions. This story focused on the American soil, where experts are brought in to decode the alien language. How the rest of tale develops was told in the remaining parts.\nTo me it smells like a trilogy. If not, it should be. I enjoyed it, mainly because of being a drama. Sci-fi is always associated with action, adventure and thriller, but this drama was something fresh as per todays computer graphics dominated cinema world.

The main thrust is that Amy Adams has to find out what the aliens want before any other country can fuck it up and they did a great job in casting Amy Adams. I\'m not usually any more than indifferent of Adams, but she does a great job here with what she\'s given. Jeremy Renner does as good as Jeremy Renner can do with a character that isn\'t just stoic bad-ass. I like Renner, but unlike other alien films, Arrival isn\'t an ""alien invasion"" movie where he can run around shooting stuff and making quips, so I\'m not sure he was the best choice. The only other actor of note is Forrest Whitaker, who does fine, but he has this stupid accent that has no purpose. I had to watch interviews with him to make sure he wasn\'t just doing an accent every other time and this was his real voice. No, he does some unnatural accent that really draws you out of the film because there is no reason for it. It\'s not a foreign accent or a regional one (or at least not one that I\'ve ever heard), it\'s just some made up shit he does for no reason. The plot is fine for where they are trying to go with the story. Personally, there are some tropes that I really fucking hate and Arrival rides on one of the ones I hate the most. I won\'t say what it is, because Arrival really should not be spoiled, but subjectively it was a stupid bullshit play and it makes things unnecessarily confusing. Arrival is about the aliens coming to Earth, but that serves more as the gasoline that fuels the very human drama that is very dialog driven and much more about Amy Adams than any of the aliens. I\'m unclear about how long the movie takes place, but once they establish the motive of the movie, it feels cheap to skip a huge chunk of time and give us a montage of what happens instead of keeping the flow of progression. The movie takes place mostly in Montana and we get some beautiful scenery and the sets are all great. The cinematography has some interesting ideas and they use shots and colors to enhance the plot. not just document it. Hearing the comparisons to Interstellar, I was afraid of how arrogant, indulgent, and pretentious Arrival might be and while I understand now what they were trying to convey with the comparison, Arrival is none of those things. Arrival doesn\'t pretend that it\'s more than it is. There are a few story that keep my personal score from going beyond a four, but I don\'t see how anyone who watches Arrival knowing what kind of movie Arrival is could give it much less. If you put on Arrival expecting Mars Attacks, Alien, Independence Day, or any other sci-fi spectacle films you are going to be disappointed, Arrival is much more of a drama. Sure, it is technically a sci-fi because aliens, but that\'s not the drive of the film. If you choose to watch Arrival with the understanding that it can be slow and aggravating and has none of the flash and awe of a typical Sci-Fi, but replaces those with authentic characters and drama, don\'t think you will be disappointed.'], ['90%', 'Well damn.\nI couldn\'t stop thinking about this one and may not for awhile. ""Arrival"" is one of the best Sci-Fi films I\'ve seen in this year. Everything about this film was just top notch that I can\'t put into words without going all over.\nSo let put it like this:\nAmy Adams was wonderful in this. A very grounded and real performance. Probably her best. Same thing that can said about Jeremy Renner.\nAnd how the aliens were part of the story was fascinating and quite clever. Without spoiling anything, they had a unique look to them. Like spiders. Although out the film, you feel their presence. A presence that\'s both scary and yet remarkable.\nDenis Villeneuve is my favorite working director. He can release a movie every year and still be close of making a masterpiece. Villeneuve delivers a haunting and heartbreaking story that leaves the audience with a experience that will stay with them.

For those with keen critical thinking skills, the seemingly foreign creatures at the beginning are not who we initially believed them to be by the end. This film amazingly weaves an abundance of profound images/clues in plain sight. Just like one of those optical illusions, which can at first appear a random assortment of dots. Yet, once your focus kicks in and you seize upon a detailed shape, you suddenly see an enormously complex picture that has been there the whole time, seemingly invisible just prior.\nAs I watched this film, I was curious about the shape of the aliens. They do not really conform to the aesthetic of an advanced species. While I internally wrestled with the purpose of this particular shape... it finally made sense. Boom!! Mind Blown!!!!\nI've heard people try to reconcile the linear/non-linear information as it unfolds in real time. This is certainly rich for grasping a fuller meaning and added depth. However, imho, the epicenter of meaning in this visual masterpiece begins with the shape of the aliens.\nIf you can unwrap that, you'll become like heroic linguist Elizabeth Banks, and decipher the deeper meaning behind this profound story.""], ['100%', ""This may be my new favourite film. I was so emotionally involved in this film, and I'd be lying if I didn't admit a few tears were shed towards the end.""], ['80%', ""An excellent film, where the main theme is not what it seems.\nIn general, I'm not a big fan of movies involving aliens... in part because they seem extremely unlikely to me (I don't really believe there is another planet with intelligent and skilled living beings like humans, or at least not developed enough to see us visit). However, I really enjoyed this film, which takes advantage of the visit of twelve spaceships from other worlds to make us question the way we view the passage of time and its linear nature. Critically acclaimed, the film received mixed reviews from audiences, with a number of detractors and admirers alike. I personally think the film is good enough to deserve our attention and respect.\nTo understand the script, it is necessary to bear in mind that the main theme of the film is not the spaceships and the alien visit, but Time, the passage of time and the way we look at it. As such, the film uses a non-linear narrative that can sometimes be difficult for viewers to understand: through dreams, the protagonist sees her young daughter, and we are led to think that she dreams of things from the past, and that she is now divorced, and her daughter has died of illness (I think it must have been leukemia). It is only later on that we realize that this is not quite the case… I don't want to reveal much more, but to understand the film, it is necessary to consider these points well. The extraterrestrial visit thus becomes an authentic sub-plot from a certain point onwards, and the real motivation of the visit is closely linked to its language and circular writing. I think I've given enough clues.\nThe advantages of this film being as it is are linked to the reflective and meditative form it takes, which can exasperate those who wanted more action or drama. I can understand that these audiences felt defrauded in their expectations. The slow narrative can sometimes drag on too much, and the film's extremely scientific nature can also make it a little difficult to understand. In the end, the quality of the plot goes downhill, things become something more cliché and predictable, but I saw that as less of a problem.\nI liked the work of Amy Addams, I think that the actress was relatively ignored by the judges of the Oscars that year, and it would have been fair, at the very least, to be nominated for Best Actress. She did work with soul, heart and commitment. Jeremy Renner also gave us an excellent performance, perhaps one of the best of his career so far, along with “Hurt Locker”. Unfortunately, the good performances end here: there are other excellent actors, but they didn't receive good material. The most obvious case is that of Forest Whittaker, who shone in “The Last King of Scotland”, and had a flat character here, without any development. Even so, he managed to do a lot with the little he was given.\nDespite only securing one Oscar for Sound Editing, the film was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Production Design. I don't know Dennis Villeneuve's work very well, I even have the impression that this was the first film of his that I've seen. So I'm not the best person to rate it. What I can say is that I liked the director's work here: he managed to give feeling and depth to a film that, on the other hand, could have been just an excuse for a lot of visual effects and CGI. The effects are there, the CGI is good, and it works really well, but the movie is more than that! The cinematography is also good, with many blurry scenes that are fundamental to the work of creating and manipulating the environment, with the film becoming increasingly tense and mysterious. The editing was also very well executed, although there were some pacing issues. Finally, a word of praise for Johann Johannsson's soundtrack, and in particular for the choice of the melody “On the Nature of Daylight”, by Max Richter.""], ['60%', 'ok movie really boring at times. it was only interesting to the space craft and the aliens. other then that it was pretty dumb. working together and love is something the planet will never understand. well at least our leaders wont any way.']]"

Worldwide Agent 007 fans understandably maintain their embedded expectations and vision as to what calculating and cunning mission their suave and sophisticated gun-toting, martini-sipping espionage thrill-seeker will encounter in his latest globe-trotting episode. Whatever Bond enthusiasts have in mind for the future twenty-fifth entry of the “licensed to kill” Lothario they should simply settle for the present stimulating currents that trickle as mind-bending material in the polished and percolating Spectre.\nAs for the dynamic performer that have served his time with action-oriented cinematic sensibilities through three previous super-charged James Bond installments, the steely-jawed and diligent Daniel Craig is back on the saddle again for his fourth stint as the crafty 007. Naturally both ardent and casual Bond followers can rattle off the filmography of Craig’s on-screen tour of duty as the debonair and daring secret service operative and even rate the previous films as they compare and contrast each edition.  Some may give special attention to Craig’s first foray into stepping inside Bond’s explosive shoes for 2006’s Casino Royale that is considered a spectacular introduction for the dramatically trained actor. In 2008’s Quantum of Solace, it was a mixed bag at best as Bond followers for the most part gave this second 007 rendition an ambivalent sign of approval (not too many were thrilled with the awkward movie title either). Thankfully, 2012’s Skyfall bounced back for Craig’s take on the roguish Bond and made for some exceptional brownie points as the cagey spy returning to creative prominence. Now 2015’s Spectre hopes to make some hearty tie-ins to Craig’s past big screen adventures as the stoic jet-setting dynamo ridding the world of masterful riff raff.\nIn actuality, Spectre is serviceable in that it is an elaborate and excitable reminder of the preceding Bond films where bits of nostalgic elements from yesteryear are sprinkled throughout its presentation. Sure, some wily 007 fanatics may spot a few of the tossed in nods to the aforementioned Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace in particular as the proceedings unfold. For the most part, Spectre acts as a mere bridge to the launching of the upcoming 25th Bond actioner in waiting. To be fair the other Bond films have served as a welcome mat to the next chapter of the late Ian Fleming’s engaging and charismatic man of action so why should not Spectre be any different in this regard? Still, this spy caper has its signature swagger that Bond aficionados relish with familiarity: heart-pumping action sequences, exquisite locales, desirable and devious Bond women, majestic car chases, larger-than-life villains and their loyal henchmen, imaginative gadgets and inventive technology and yes…the indomitable James Bond at your service. Nevertheless. the minor knock on Spectre is that it could have risen to the occasion more than it did as it occasionally feels as if it is going through the mischievous motions. It never resorts to the levels of Bond-ish drudgery in Quantum of Solace so that certainly is a relief in that aspect.\nSpectre does incorporate its share of opulence, mystery, suspense, shadowy tension and perilous plight. However, where the standard Bond film-making characteristics are somewhat consistent and captivating (i.e. the breathtaking opening sequence of the Day of the Dead celebration in Mexico City) there is also a questionable consideration for the weak-kneed Bond theme song in Sam Smith’s “Writing’s on the Wall” which seems so inadequately suited for a James Bond signature tune. Even the indifferent observers of the James Bond film franchise for the last five decades can attest to the two most important stamps of a Bond film–its opening scene and surging theme song.  Thankfully, Spectre’s grand opening sequence obeys traditional Bond practices but Smith’s doggedly tired-sounding “Writing’s on the Wall” feels as it belongs attached to an old televised After School special from the mid-70s. Wouldn’t you give your kingdom for Paul McCartney and Wings’ “Live and Let Die” or Carly Simon’s “Nobody Does It Better” or perhaps even Sheena Easton’s “For Your Eyes Only”?\nOne thing that can be said about Craig’s Bond in Spectre and that is his image transformation has been elevated to that of a fashion plate whose GQ stylized look has taken quite a step up. Not since Roger Moore’s Bond has there been a clear case of dazzling attire on display for Agent 007 to strut his stuff in spiffy clothing accessories throughout his ventured travels. Craig, billed as a “blue-collar” Bond whose demeanor is more blunt and workman-like, takes comfort in basking in the finesse shadows of a classic Agent 007 almost foreign to his distinctive spin on the iconic spy. In fact, the overall vibe for Spectre seems to lie in the middle of old school and new school James Bond mythology where the shading suits both camps of the ever-lasting film franchise.\nDirector Sam Mendes, who handled the direction for the previous Skyfall, finds the right tone and temple for Spectre that certainly shows off its lavish and ambitious production values as the set designs, scenic locations, fabulous pre-credits action sequence are all indescribable in majestic scope. No one can accuse Spectre as to not holding its own in visual functionality. Wisely, Mendes does not forget his Skyfall background players as they reunite with Craig’s Bond and partake in the sensationalized cat-and-mouse caper. It is refreshing to see Ralph Fiennes back as “M” not to mention Ben Wishaw’s “Q” front and center. And a Craig-fronted Bond film would not be the same without Naomie Harris as Miss Moneypenny.\nAgent 007 fans will find a common ""Bond"" with Daniel Craig and his fourth outing as the licensed to kill Lothario in the stunning and kinettic SPECTRE\nAgent 007 fans will find a common “Bond” with Daniel Craig and his fourth outing as the licensed to kill Lothario in the stunning and kinetic SPECTRE\nIt is a given that the diabolical criminal network known as SPECTRE has always had its affiliation with the Bond universe especially in the classic Sean Connery Bond-age years. Instinctively, SPECTRE’s evil heart and soul was pumped continuously by that organization’s dastardly mastermind Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Oscar winner Christoph Waltz does the sordid honors of taking the reins as Bond’s nemesis Franz Oberhauser in Spectre with devilish delight and is more colorfully corrupt thanks to his handy go-to muscular minion Mr. Hinx (ex-professional WWE wrestler and “Guardians of the Galaxy” star Dave Bautista) echoing the memories of beloved brute Jaws (played by the late Richard Kiel) from The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker).\nWe can never forget that along with Agent 007 folklore comes the responsibility of being labeled a treasured Bond babe. And although the latest sultry women represented in Spectre will never make us forget the iconic likes of Dr. No’s Ursula Andress (Honey Ryder) or Casino Royale’s Eva Green (Vesper Lynd) for that matter they still hold their own and give a measure of titillation to both Bond and the vast amount of male admirers wishing they carried a gun and wore expensive tuxedos while being at the receiving end of a provocative smooch by these vibrant vixens. Lea Seydoux’s Madelene Swann and Italian siren Monica Bellucci’s Lucia are on board as the Bond bombshells for hire.\nAs a whole, Spectre has its up and down moments and never is quite sure about standing alone as an independent Bond story or being dismissed as a pit stop for 007-related flashbacks and reference bits ode to yesteryear’s glory of the super spy’s engaging and raging exploits. The verdict is that Spectre ultimately satisfies one’s craving for the invincible James Bond whether you can to relive his vintage reputation or look forward to a millennium-enhanced production that will grow with the ageless wonderment pertaining to Fleming’s literary ladies man-turned movie-making mainstay of action-packed cinema for half a century. As one-time Bond songbird Carly Simon would attest in her soothing lyrics, “nobody does it better…”  Yet in the dimensional escapist world of James Bond this particular go-around could have been a tad bit better.\nSpectre (2015)\nSony Pictures\n2 hrs 28 mins.\nStarring: Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Naomie Harris, Ben Whishaw, Dave Bautista, Monica Bellucci, Andrew Scott\nDirected by: Sam Mendes\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\nGenre: Spy-Espionage Caper/Action & Adventure/Suspense Thriller\nCritic’s rating: ** 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\n(c) Frank Ochieng (2015)'], ['-', 'In hindsight my excitement for Spectre seems a bit foolish. After Skyfall, director Sam Mendes openly stated that he wouldn’t direct another Bond movie. And even so, Skyfall wasn’t the best of the new Bond films by any measure – dragging on for much too long. But somehow I got sucked into the hype of Mendes’ vision for an homage to the classic Bond, with that somewhat iconic poster of Craig mimicking Roger Moore, and trailers the emphasized a kind of retro re-visitation of some old villains and themes. But Spectre is none of those things, instead it is a film where everyone involved feels like they are just going through the motions. Spectre tries very hard to be an homage to the vintage James Bond classics, but instead ends up feeling more like a mockery of the series.\nFor starters the script is outrageously weak and predictable. Bond goes from shootout, to chase, to sex scene, saying and doing the exact same things he has done for the last 23 movies. Instead of a complete story, the film is just a collection of set pieces and scenes loosely stitched together. And while some of them work well on their own, by the second or third fight scene, you won’t be able to stop yourself from yawning. When you aren’t yawning you’ll be laughing, and not in a good way. The dialogue is downright cheesy. Gone is all of Bond’s smooth charm and ability to sting his opponent’s with his tongue just as much as with his gun. Instead at one point, he throws a watch bomb and says: “Time flies!”\nBond is one a secret mission, assigned to him by M (Judi Dench) via a video message delivered after her death. The film doesn’t ever attempt to invest the audience in this mission, or in Bond’s motivation for seeking out Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz) – which apparently has something to do with his foster-father and his childhood, again – but it never seems important to the story or to James. Meanwhile, a new joint secretary, Max or C as he is known (Andrew Scott), is attempting to unite the world’s intelligence under one surveillance network – and through doing so making the Double-0 program obsolete. Lucky for him, Sam Mendes is already doing that for him.\nHowever, Spectre is a beautiful film. There are about five or six huge set pieces, all of which are wonderfully filmed. And if you are just in the mood the veg out and watch Bond cruise through the streets of Rome in a prototype Aston Martin, than this is the movie for you. But things go on for entirely too long, which would be fine if something of interest were happening. But almost nothing does. Bond gets in a situation and gets out, all while throwing a few pithy, laughable, lines out.\nDaniel Craig has never been more disconnected from the character James Bond, than he is in Spectre. I must say first, that I love Craig as an actor and as James Bond – he is my favorite of all the Bonds. But here, he is uncharacteristically not James Bond. A scene for instance where bond throws his gun into the river, is done in such a fancy foppish way that I cringed. It is tough to properly convey how Craig misses the mark in Spectre, but when you see it, you won’t be able to help feeling the same way.\nMaybe Sam Mendes and screenwriter John Logan did succeed at creating a perfect homage to the Roger Moore era Bond films? Because in reality, none of those films standout as great movies. From start to finish, Spectre feels like someone filling out a madlibs of Bond scenes, and praying that when they read it back, it makes some sense.'], ['70%', ""Not your usual Bond movie, but still a good entertainer.\nWhat I liked from a couple of last Bond movies was they were off the regular 007 style, like not overly rely on spy's special gadgets.

Anyway, he's the most fittest (muscular) Bond I've ever seen and he's celebrating 10 year anniversary with this film release. But the question is whether he to do another film or done with the franchise. The doubt after the confusing end of this film.\nThe end was quite clear on the story perspective, so I kind of felt it was a farewell for Craig. But, later I came to know that the official source says Bond25 will be his fifth and so on till he opts out himself. 'Spectre' was a very simple Bond movie I have ever seen, but I can say the production quality was so good that you can't resist the enjoyment. The actors, they were also good, but not as I anticipated. Maybe many scenes were very ordinary for a Bond movie, that's comparable with the nowadays action movies, otherwise it was not as bad as critics expressing their disappointment.\nYou can't believe what I was disappointed, you know when they say what the C stands for - is that the best word they come up with against the M for Moron? Anyway, James Bond movies have always had ups and downs, the last film 'Skyfall' was a mega hit and now this has not stood up to that standard.

The dynamic lacks jeopardy - we know who is likely to be behind the cunning plots right from the start and neither Fiennes nor Scott bring much to the party. Indeed the latter is really rather poor. What menace there is, is delivered via some underwhelming contributions from Dave Bautista\'s ""Hinx"" and from the appearances of Christoph Waltz, but they are all too infrequent to bolster the storyline before an ending that was, frankly, ridiculous - even by ""Quantum of Solace"" (2008) standards. The producers seem to be constantly trying to reinvent ""Bond"" without realising that the more they compromise the standards of the story and weaken the traditional characters, the less impact the franchise has when surrounded by many others of this genre that benefit from stronger writing and a more charismatic star.

Unfortunately, these expectations climbed too high for Spectre to meet. While the story did a decent job of trying to tie all the Craig Bond films together and introduce a new supreme criminal mastermind, it didn't fully satisfy or carry the weight it intended. There were some exceptional action sequences, with the opening scene in Mexico City as one of the most stunning and impressive of the franchise. The train fight with Dave Bautista was incredibly entertaining as well, but much of the action felt restrained like Craig was tired of the role and didn't want to push the boundaries on some stunts. Seydoux and Bellucci each brought something new with their Bond Girl portrayals providing emotional exploration and depth unusual for a Bond film. Spectre is a great spy movie and a fun Bond flick, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to the level of hype and expectation set before it.

The motivation of characters other than 007 is total zero in credibility. The inspiration is zero. The strategy is zero. The dialog is clumsy.\nThis is to be expected from the changes around 1970, when the writer\'s guild became immensely jealous of talent and good writing, and only produced the writers with zero talent.\nAnd now those writers are the ""judges"" of new writers, God help this culture.\nThe change in format should have changed long ago, about 1995, into ""sons and daughters of 007"", with 007 as a background figure, say fifth or sixth billing, with his sons and daughters taking center stage in this ""less action, more computer"" world.\nA lot of us said this well before 1995. It was painfully obvious, but we live in a world where Hollywood went total hack in the seventies, with those hacks endorsing the worst hacks of today.\n""Spectre"" kind of gives us an introspective look at this with the timeline element. Bond faces the usual super enemy power, and fights the establishment which brings in the computer age.\nThe character of 007 is the only thing that is salvaged in these new movies. It isn\'t Daniel Craig\'s fault that he is 007 for the worst writers, writers who are into the neo Nazi ideology of the seventies where women must be blond and pale, and any man who tries to save a brunette is doomed, but save a blond, and you\'re a success. The Hitler worship is so extreme in the modern Bond movie writing that it\'s impossible to deny it is there. \nAnd the directors are pathetic. Even given the ideal exotic locales, they manage to dumb down the scenery. One feels like the director actually says ""How can we make this beautiful and exotic scenery look dull and depressing? Aha! I can do it!""\nOf course the day will come when Craig will be the beneficiary of this fame and get to do actually good films for which he\'ll be remembered. \nThis movie is pretty much formula.

The price of admission is expensive, there is only one film theater in my city (every time I want to watch a movie on IMAX or Dolby Atmos, it\'s a financial effort and time-consuming) and the worst of all, a whole bunch of films aren\'t released in their original date, especially November/December Oscar-bait movies. Only now I had the opportunity to see Green Book, and I am so mad I wasn\'t able to write its review in 2018 because this is undoubtedly the best comedy-drama of last year and one of the best overall!\nWith the help of a terrific cast, Peter Farrelly and his writing crew (which counts with Vallelonga\'s son, Nick) deliver what I think is the best screenplay of 2018. I can\'t remember the last time I cried of so much laughter in a film. I can\'t remember the last time I did the latter and still got emotional with the dramatic arc. This comedy-drama sent me through a roller coaster of emotions I wasn\'t expecting, at all. I went in anticipating outstanding performances (check) and solely that. Since 2019 has already begun, I\'m watching the Oscar-bait movies with no real hopes of being utterly amazed.\nHowever, Green Book completely took me by surprise. I genuinely don\'t know why everyone was so shocked when it won Best Screenplay at the Golden Globe Awards. It possesses such a well-written story, filled with brilliant narratives about the most sensitive subjects. It takes the two main characters and elevates their individual arcs into subplots where you begin and end with two completely different personas. It\'s an extremely relevant film that shows how our world evolved and fought back racism and discrimination, without ever becoming too dark or even dull. It\'s not more of the same, it\'s not another movie produced exclusively to send a social message and catch some Oscar nominations. It\'s a truly captivating story of how two men can change their perspective of another race or even the entire world, by actually spending time with another culture and ignoring preconceived notions.\nNevertheless, this well-structured, beautifully-directed and cleverly-written film would be just ""good"" if not for the two incredible actors, who take this movie to a whole other level. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have such compelling chemistry that I wouldn\'t mind watching them interact for two hours on a car trip. Every single car sequence either produces hilarious moments, filled with tearful laughter, or it drastically changes into a more dramatic and emotional tone, subtly touching delicate topics. I knew Mortensen had a humorous side to him, but I never saw this coming! His timing, his expressions, his Italian accent, his body movements, everything about his performance is perfect. He absolutely nailed his part, by giving me the best time I had at a film theater in a long time, and his Oscar nomination is more than fair. He made a 130-min feature movie feel like a short flick.\nAli doesn\'t come far behind. Obviously, since Viggo has a funnier role to portray, the audience members might feel that he\'s just there to help his co-star shine, but he does much more than that. Since he brings the drama element to the story, he has a more restrained performance during the first half of the film. However, once Shirley starts getting along with Tony Lip, Ali gradually offers more and more splendid acting moments. He\'s definitely a supporting actor, but God is he a phenomenal one! Linda Cardellini (Dolores Vallelonga), even though she\'s only on-screen for a few minutes spread throughout the runtime, also delivers a great performance.\nTony Lip and Dr. Don Shirley have quite distinct personalities, besides being from different races. Each character\'s arc is brilliantly illustrated by Peter Farrelly, who gradually shows how Tony and Don are changing their view of the world and of each other\'s culture. Either through the witty car sequences or through unfortunate and horrible experiences, these two characters carry the audience on a journey of growth. Change in behavior, mindset and preconceived ideas, by sharing their own culture with another. Even though they were born in different countries and lived through distinguished lifestyles, with contrasting quality of life, they eventually start realizing that what they think of the world and everything else might not be entirely right.\nTechnically, Farrelly controls the movie\'s pacing exceptionally well, by making a two-hour-ish film feel like half of it. Remarkably-balanced tone and some great cinematography is showed in a couple of scenes. Consistently-filmed and well-edited, even though the latter has small hiccups here and there. Nevertheless, this isn\'t a film with extraordinary technical attributes, nor it needs them. Farrelly only needed to do ""ok"" with the producing and filming of a standout screenplay to achieve a fantastic result, and that\'s exactly what he did.\nFinally, regarding the controversy surrounding this movie ... See how easy it is to watch a film without being affected by outside matters which don\'t have a single thing to do with the movie itself? I don\'t care if someone who worked in the film tweeted something wrong today, let alone years ago. I don\'t care if someone misinterprets Viggo Mortensen\'s speech about racism. I don\'t care if the family of Don Shirley doesn\'t like how the movie approaches his way of being or his way of life. I don\'t care if the story isn\'t 100% true, as long as it succeeds in transmitting the vital message it wants to deliver, while actually being a good film. So, please, stop trying to listen to everything everyone says about a movie or the people working on it, especially nowadays, where chaos is easy to create.\nGreen Book surprised the hell out of me and left me speechless in the end. One of the best comedy-dramas I\'ve seen in a long time, one of the best films of 2017 and, by far, the best original screenplay of the last year. Peter Farrelly and his fellow co-writers delivered a seamlessly-written story, filled with wonderful character arcs and with a quite important message to the audiences around the world. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali deliver award-worthy performances, especially the former who shows his incredible comedic timing and dramatic range. Still, the most compelling and emotional scenes come from Ali, and he does not deserve to be forgotten. I thought 2018 was going to be the first year without me giving an A+, but guess what ...\nRating: A+'], ['90%', '""Frequently, when someone tries to portray the overwhelming decade of the 1960s, they usually misuse the concept of discrimination towards African Americans, which is accurate to describe this social issue. Nevertheless, the way Peter Farrelly and staff go into detail about this social wretchedness embodying the psychological impact it has in the main character makes the film an outstanding one"".\nThe year is 1962, and the film begins inside Copacabana restaurant where we get introduced the imposing personality of Tony Lip, an Italian descendant whose family came from a lower middle class coping with some financial difficulties. The way Viggo Mortensen performs the character is a proper model of then American racism; therefore he attempted to keep them out until the occasion arrived and Don Shirley appeared in his path, offering him a two-month lifetime opportunity. We all need to bear in mind the precise dates because, in real life, it was nearly a year they spent together. Despite his gifted pianist skills and his upper-class status, he was still a victim of the convulsed cultural impact. Both of them, during the film, learn from each other and fight against the unsettling behaviour of determined people.\nAlthough it may seem simple, their interaction is one of the primary reasons why it succeeds. Believe it or not, it arouses curiosity, reaches the climax when they finally let them know as they are, and sometimes it results as a plot twister due to the radical temperament change of each actor. It has been ages since I watched such a pleasant film; afterwards, I felt refreshed as though it renewed me.\nThe contextualisation was imperative to build up each one\'s personality; moreover, it was visually dazzling owing to the costumes, the space and the background advertisement of the decade.

This Blumhouse picture was later rescheduled, and was at one point never to see the light of day, which would have been a crushing blow knowing how relevant this actually turned out to be. Luckily for us, Blumhouse soon caught on and realised movies like The Hunt are exactly what our cruel audience’s need right now, something with a sharp satirical bite with a gut-punching narrative reflective of modern society. Welcome to my favourite horror movie of the past few years.\nImagine a Twitter thread was made into a movie, this is The Hunt. What we have here is a film that functions on the confliction that exists in the real-world between liberals and conservatives, as they take chunks out of each other when discussing politics online, spilling blood on each side as opinions and views are torn to shit by the opposing party. What is depicted is literal death and carnage, which is representative of how the different identities and political views that are one person's beliefs, but another’s infuriating joke.\nImage result for the hunt 2020 film\nThe beauty here (which is addressed as a massive concern to most reviewers) is the lack of depth to these characters within The Hunt, and to their lifestyle choices and political standpoints. What works best is that it never takes a stance when mocking both sides of the political spectrum, and allows us as an audience to identify which whatever our political views lead us to, even if one side is draped in murderous overtones. I admire how we are left to decide where we would stand, and if what is happening is something we can sympathise with. To most, what I’m saying sounds ridiculous, but this lack of depth to these characters is very much reflective on the current state of our social media, having people who we know nothing about spreading their views which are toxic to half and relatable to others.\nIt’s that online façade that is at play here, as we witness comments and statements daily that tear down others, ruin people’s professional statuses or simply to spread offensive and insensitive comments online to troll others. This is the world we live in, and the characters in The Hunt exist within our real world. The characters within this may not be fleshed out, but to the online profiles with nothing but a name, a picture and a flurry of controversial tweets neither are they, and that certainly looks like modern day humanity to me.\nMuch of The Hunt’s satirical sting comes from its reliance on our current climate and political correctness, which leans on its accurate depiction of society to get its laughs in when it can. It’s understandable that this particular sense of humour might to a little too one-note for some, but it firmly has its own tongue planted in its cheek when openly mocking our current way of thinking, juxtaposing these characters with opposing mind-sets to create a genuinely clever and on-the-nose depiction on humanity’s contemporary views. Aside from the intelligent links to modern society, it’s also really enjoyable and highly entertaining when utilised to its full potential. One could be offended by some of the humour here, but when the film itself jokes on our own generation of snowflakes, it begs the question if The Hunt is pointing the finger at you, and calling you out for being said snowflake. It all really works for me on a sharply pungent level, one that had me tickled pink until the final credits. The Hunt ultimately holds up a darkly comedic mirror up to the political divisions in a way that hasn’t been explored to this stature.\nImage result for the hunt 2020\nThe action here is outstanding, with the violence being the appropriate level of over the top to match its exuberant premise. Betty Giplin is undeniably outstanding as she delivers a powerhouse of a performance in her portrayal of Crystal, a tough as nails heroine who easily establishes herself in the ranks next to such genre greats as Erin from You’re Next and Alien’s Ripley. Her level of badass is contagiously ferocious, making every scene she’s in an absolute blast to witness. Each fight scene is crafted brilliantly, looking seamlessly effortless with its high-energy intensity, most notably when we reach our final act in which our Million Dollar Baby Hillary Swank comes head-to-head with Giplin, which can only be described as one of the most entertaining fight scenes in recent horror memory.\nNothing is ever fully dripping in suspense, but you soon realise it doesn’t need to be when you’re watching enigmatic fight scenes that are as vicious as they are diverting. The film also works its best when it plays at its most unexpected, knocking familiar faces off like Drew Barrymore in Scream level of unexpected in ways so gleefully gory it will have you laughing with sheer shock. The Hunt may split audiences right down the middle, but there is one thing that is universal, and that’s that Betty Giplin’s Crystal is already this decades best Final Girl.\nVERDICT \nProving to be one of the strongest contemporary social and political horror movies in recent memory, The Hunt is a lean, mean, fighting machine that is as sharply satirical as it is viciously violent. Make room for Betty Giplin, our new final girl is in town.\n★★★★★""], ['80%', 'If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\nIn case you don\'t know, I\'m from Portugal. Why does this matter? Well, The Hunt was delayed after a massive shooting in the USA, and since the movies\' themes are extremely sensitive, the producers decided to postpone the film. At the time, I felt frustrated that, once again, movies have to suffer from real-life situations. Going to the theater is supposed to be an ""out of this world"" experience. The audience is transported into a fictional place where real-world problems can be forgotten for a couple of hours. So, I never handled these constant controversies surrounding films very well...\nWith that said, I believe The Hunt not only benefited from that delay, but its satirical story has even more impact now. There\'s no way around this. Craig Zobel\'s movie is meant to be one of the most divisive films of the last few years. I know it\'s a pretty basic analogy, but it\'s just like a dark humor standup show. If you don\'t have any issues with jokes about topics like racism, stereotypes, immigration, refugees, religion, politics, and every sensitive theme that your mind can imagine, then you\'ll find The Hunt a brilliant allegory of society\'s most extreme people. If you do have problems with this type of comedy, then stay away from this movie because Damon Lindelof and Nick Cuse go all out!\nWhen I write that every remotely sensitive taboo subject or activity is unrestrainedly addressed, I mean EVERY SINGLE theme. This is a narrative completely packed with extreme, over-the-top cliches and stereotypes of both right and left political sides. At first glance, The Hunters feel like the ""bad guys"", in the sense that they\'re hunting innocent people for pure pleasure. Once the audience understands the reasons behind the selection of the people being hunted, one small but tremendously effective thought enters everyone\'s mind: ""you know what... the world would actually be a better place without this kind of people"".\nSuddenly, not a single character is worth caring about. To clarify, I don\'t mean ""caring about"" in the common, emotional way. No character is written with the purpose of making the audience worry about it. In fact, almost every character (maybe except Betty Gilpin\'s) is a despicable human being. Their view of the world is clouded by ideologically outdated mentalities. I love how the screenwriters use each character to represent a particular type of ... extreme personality, let\'s call it that. One of the best compliments I can give the film is that it didn\'t pick a side. Everyone gets blasted with jokes.\nIt\'s a dark yet hilarious satire of today\'s society with a special focus on the close-minded people that go online to try and spread their conspiracy theories and immoral beliefs. Everything that I just wrote so far resembles the movie\'s impact on the viewer: either you\'re okay with this type of screenplay and you\'ll be incredibly entertained; or you\'ll get extremely triggered by all this. It\'s one of those films that will end up on a bunch of ""Worst Movies of 2020"" lists simply due to its narrative\'s nature.\nHowever, the story isn\'t the only aspect that can make people give up on watching this movie. The actual hunt is as over-the-top as everything else. There\'s blood everywhere, ridiculously disgusting deaths, and absolutely no limits whatsoever in killing people in the most insanely entertaining way possible. Action-wise, The Hunt is better filmed than a lot of blockbusters. Beautiful wide shots when something (or someone) explodes, exceptional (and hilariously long) choreography for the ""final fight"", and excellent editing overall. It\'s genuinely a well-made, well-produced, and well-filmed movie. The score is also pretty cool.\nObviously, it\'s one of those films that\'s easy to pinpoint flaws. Every single paragraph that I wrote above can be interpreted as some of the worst aspects of the entire movie, depending on each person\'s perspective. In my opinion, I think the ending would have benefited from a more serious tone, but at the same time, it would probably clash with the widespread satirical one, so it\'s an inevitably difficult ending to completely get right. The cast is a bit hit-and-miss when it comes to each actor\'s performance (some are very bland), but Betty Gilpin delivers an outstanding display and seamlessly carries the whole film. Finally, there\'s a small part of the movie that involves military characters who don\'t belong to either side of The Hunt, and that portion didn\'t really work for me.\nAll in all, The Hunt is a brilliantly dark satire on today\'s political views of the world. It\'s meant to be one of the most divisive films of the last few years, and it undoubtedly succeeds in its mission. Just like dark humor, either you\'re okay with it, or you\'re not. If you can\'t take a joke about the most extremely sensitive taboo themes (and I mean ALL of them), then stay away from this movie or you\'ll be triggered for a whole week. However, if you can see the fun side of this type of comedy, The Hunt is the most entertaining, witty, hilarious, bloody, over-the-top action thriller you\'ll see for a long time. Damon Lindelof and Nick Cuse go all out, and they don\'t forget to approach a single topic. It\'s a well-made film all-around: well-written, well-produced, and well-filmed. A few minor issues regarding its ending and a small subplot don\'t diminish Craig Zobel\'s exceptionally captivating concept and Betty Gilpin\'s compelling performance. I definitely recommend it depending on how much you enjoy dark humor.\nPS: everyone knows the tale about the rabbit and the turtle, right? How the rabbit races the turtle, and all that?

It's one of those films that sticks out in cinema history as a defining point, and some like me would say a high point as well. I recently revisited the film for the first time in about 5 years and had such a wonderful time with it, the moment John Williams exhilarating score kicks in a get goosebumps and start to believe a man can really can fly.\nThe expectation level on release of the film in 1978 was enormous, one can not understate the hugely iconic love that the DC Comic character of Superman had. A worldwide search for the right actor to don the red and blue cape was underway, Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds, Ryan O'Neal, Nick Nolte and Charles Bronson were all at times linked with the hot role, whilst James Caan and Robert Redford are confirmed to have passed after being offered the job. All of those great names now seem remarkably stupid choices, and that is purely down to the man that did take on the gargantuan role that was bursting at the seams with expectation. That Superman:The Movie worked (and still does with each passing decade) is down to the wonderful efforts of Christopher Reeve.\nReeve positively nailed both sides of the character, making it his own, he is all muscles and square jaw in the cape and then showing wonderful comic ability as the bumblingly frustrating Clark Kent. Sure the supporting cast all contribute grandly, but Reeve carries the picture and lifts it to triumphant heights. Gene Hackman has the time of his life camping it up as super villain Lex Luthor, Ned Beatty & Valerie Perrine flesh out Luthor's cohorts with comedy and sexiness respectively, whilst Margot Kidder is a pure joy as core character of the piece, Lois Lane. Asked to play a love interest but a fiercely strong woman at the same time, Kidder breezes through it and radiates a beauty that couples nicely with Reeve's broadness. Marlon Brando was paid $4 Million for what is little more than a prologue walk on part, but the big name he brought to the party ensured the paying customer went through the doors in droves, but on leaving the cinema it was Reeve's name that most were talking about.\nFull of outlandish sequences and cheeky comic book ideals, Superman is lasting the test of time as an endearing classic of the genre, it may have been surpassed by quite a few of the more modern exploits by Spiders and Bats, but it was once the Daddy of them all. From x-ray eyes to catching bullets, to pushing nuclear missiles into space and wooing Lois in the sky, Superman:The Movie is a special treat, and oh how I love you so. 9/10\nChristopher Reeve RIP.""], ['100%', '""Miss Teschmacher!""\nI didn\'t catch ""Superman"" (1978) until over 25 years after its release.

The outstanding Krypton sequences of the first half hour confirm this. These scenes are highlighted by the magnificence of Marlon Brando playing Superman\'s father Jor-El. So, if you\'re a serious Sci-Fi fan, don\'t skip ""Superman"" just because you assume it\'s some mere superhero flick. No, it\'s more, much more. The screenplay seems to have been written with little concern of cost so many are the great F/X sequences.\nSpeaking of Brando, you can\'t beat the cast, starting with newbie Christopher Reeve knocking it out of the ballpark in the starring role.\nI\'d like to point something out that is hardly ever mentioned: Lex Luthor\'s girlfriend, Miss Teschmacher, played by Valerie Perrine, is jaw-droppingly voluptuous!

Zod"" (Terence Stamp) and his co-conspirators. This all seems somewhat pointless as we soon discover that their planet is about to be decimated by it\'s nearby sun. It\'s only ""Jor-El"" and his wife ""Lara"" (Susannah York) who have the vision to build their son an escape pod and just in the nick of time launch him into space: destination Earth.

Tragedy strikes and to the city he goes where he finds work working for the irascible ""Perry White"" (Jackie Cooper) at the renowned ""Daily Planet"". He also realises that he is now free to don his red cape, remove his geeky spectacles, and become the world\'s first flying, strong-man, super-hero. These antics attract plenty of attention - not least from his colleague ""Lois"" (Margot Kidder) and from arch crook ""Lex Luthor"" (Gene Hackman). The former wants an interview (amongst other things); the latter wants to destroy him so he can carry his out his dastardly plan to redefine the geography of California. Some solidly entertaining contributions from Ned Beatty, Valerie Perrine and Marc McClure all help the consistently under-rated Reeve to own the part with a charismatic charm and to convey a quickly paced action adventure that also allows Hackman (perhaps just a bit over-scripted) to play a fun role as a baddie with megalomanic tendencies and a brain to boot. The visual effects have held up remarkably well and though I didn\'t quite love the ending, this is a strong and confident outing for Reeve that resists the temptation to overly moralise, and delivers us an enjoyable series of good vs. evil escapades that are well worth a few hours in front of a big screen with proper sound.']]"

This is one of those older movies where I can totally confirm for you, my love for it is in no way rooted in nostalgia. I didn't watch RoboCop for the first time until 2013, when I was starting up my third decade of life. It's a phenomenal example of the period, but its also a great movie on its own.\nFinal rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite.""], ['90%', ""They'll fix you. They fix everything.\nOn his first day out on the streets of Detroit, Officer Murphy is brutally killed by known thug leader, Clarence Boddicker. Scientists at OCP are able to use what remains of Murphy's body and build a new heavily armed cyborg police officer, one that could rid the streets of crime forever.\nPaul Verhoeven has been called many things in his career, bonkers, challenging and visionary, here with his first perceived block buster American feature, he showcases all of those things. Robocop on the page (and with its title) looked like your average run of the mill sci-fi shoot them up, with its basic premise not exactly oozing originality either. But Verhoeven had screenwriter's Edward Neumeier & Michael Miner in his corner, and they came up with a superior script to fully realise his vision. That Robocop is a satirical critique of totalitarianism and corporate corruption is now a given. Yet it wasn't at first evident to the summer block buster crowd, but Robocop has stood up well to critical re-examinations and the depth digging that so many have afforded it.\nSo with the script he wanted in place, Verhoeven utilised his memories from childhood, where his Netherlands home was taken over by a stomping German army, and added in the destruction factor, with no amount of technical expertise as well. Verhoeven paints an unhinged portrait of this Detroit (actual location shoot was parts of Texas), with skew whiff angles and bizarre twists lining the picture, the special effects even today looking tremendous. Robocop is extremely violent, especially in the directors cut that's now widely available, but even during the most wincing scenes, it stays brisk and sparky, and on his side is that his characters are as inhuman as the title protagonist is!. Thus the fusion of berserker sci-fi and human realism sits easy with the viewer, with the result serving notice to what a fine director Verhoeven can be.\nPeter Weller dons the Robo suit (enduring agony for weeks on end apparently) and does what is required, and Nancy Allen kicks buttocks as Murphy's partner, Anne Lewis. But it's with the unsavoury characters that Robocop gains its acting kudos. Ronny Cox, Miguel Ferrer and a wickedly vile Kurtwood Smith dominate proceedings, helped immeasurably by the nature of the script. Verhoeven is thought to be a hard character on set, demanding much from all involved, even driving the normally amiable Weller to thoughts of violence against his director. But few, if any of those involved in Robocop can now say the final result wasn't worth it, because between them they made a genre classic. 9/10""], ['90%', ""Seen this several times over the years and still holds up well, story and satire wise, though certainly some of the effects were dated (in particular the death of one character falling out a window).

Pretty soon, though, he discovers that he is amidst a web of corruption. Can he stay alive, keep his partner ""Anne"" (Nancy Allen) safe and thwart the evil plot that may well be tied into the criminals who left him for dead in the first place? Plenty of action and pyrotechnics follow as the story marches along to it\'s pretty obvious conclusion. Plenty of pace, some pretty banal dialogue - it\'s all the usual stuff that I found adequate, but really pretty dated now.

A 163-minute runtime rarely feels this light, thanks to the contributions of the sublime cast – Hayley Atwell is outstanding – and the truly memorable score that elevates all the otherworldly set pieces.\nIt has the ""problem"" of being the first of two parts, with some unnatural, repetitive exposition scenes that get in the way of its progress, in addition to a somewhat generic, ambiguous narrative around A.I.\nNevertheless, it\'s a summer blockbuster in its purest form, as you\'d expect from the icon Tom Cruise, to whom we owe our allegiance.""\nRating: A-'], ['70%', 'In the interest of full disclosure, I’m often somewhat skeptical about films that include the word “part” in their titles; I frequently feel that such offerings have difficulty standing on their own, unable to complete their stories in a single vehicle. So, admittedly, that consideration was on my mind as I screened the first half of the final installment in this long-running action-adventure franchise. To its credit, director Christopher McQuarrie’s latest has a lot going for it – an intriguing plot with a strong cautionary tale message for us about the potential dangers of AI, an array of superbly staged action sequences, the welcome addition of some much-needed comic relief (something this series has often lacked) and a fine cast of supporting performers (especially the expanded role of Vanessa Kirby, who was woefully underused in the franchise’s previous release). However, with that said, there are some elements that could use improvement. For starters, the picture is simply too long; with a runtime of 2:43:00 (and this is just the first half of the story!), the film is definitely bloated and could stand some judicious editing, especially in the action sequences, several of which begin to try one’s patience after a while. Then there are certain aspects of the narrative that are predictable, formulaic, and, at times, implausible (particularly in the picture’s overlong final act train adventure sequence), qualities that are not as apparent (or at least better hidden) in previous outings. Finally, there are the underwhelming performances of the IMF crew (Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames). The leader of the pack (Cruise) comes across more like someone whose presence is designed largely to carry the plot rather than serve as a genuine, actively engaged protagonist, and his two colleagues are underused, seemingly playing sidekick roles rather than participating as key characters (unlike previous installments in the series). All told, this is by no means a bad picture, but it could have been better, especially with it being the series finale. It makes me wonder if the full story of “Dead Reckoning” might have been better executed in a single, slightly longer offering than as two separate feature-length releases. That might have solved the issues noted above, and it may have eliminated that nagging “part” problem I wrote about, allowing the picture to stand on its own two feet as a single vehicle. We’ll have to wait another year to see how it all plays out, but I can’t exactly say I’m holding my breath about it.'], ['70%', 'I\'m not really a great fan of Tom Cruise. Yes, he does his own stunts and is as fit as a fiddle, but as an actor - well don\'t let\'s have too many scenes that require him to actually put his heart and soul into them. Luckily, there are only a few such scenes here as the rest of this is an enjoyable, quickly paced, continuation of the MI strand with this time, an elusive antagonist that reminded me a little of the ""Forbin Project"" (1970). The military have created the perfect intelligence that is locked into the sonar dome of a state-of-the-art Russian submarine. Seems though, that this dome isn\'t that impregnable and when a cleverly manipulated catastrophe hits the sub, it soon becomes clear that this gadget has, and is rapidly honing, a mind of it\'s own. The only way to stop it is to obtain the two conjoining parts of a cruciform key - and then discover the location of the sunken wreck, if there is to be any hope of thwarting it taking over the world. The story is more the stuff of ""007"", I thought, but it is a good, solid and well written story - and one that resonates well on a planet where technology and communications are pervasive across all aspects of our lives. Together with Ving Rhames and the (always annoying, sorry) Simon Pegg it falls to ""Ethan"" (Cruise) to ally with his deadly pal ""Ilsa"" (Rebecca Ferguson) and the nimble-fingered ""Grace"" (Hayley Atwell) to stop the key from falling into the hands of the enigmatic ""Gabriel"" (Esai Morales). End-to-end action; trains, planes and automobiles, parachutes and just like in ""Fast X"" (2023) poor old Rome comes in for a bit of a pasting - as does Venice and the Orient Express would now present even ""Hercule Poirot"" with an insurmountable whodunnit challenge. It\'s entertaining and serves well as a vehicle for the star, setting up the concluding part which, of course, leaves the plot here having to be a little undercooked and a touch predictable. Better than I was expecting and well worth a big screen outing.'], ['60%', ""Spectacular cinematic action let down by an incoherent story and shallow characterisations.\nAs is almost always the case with the MI franchise, the latest offering dishes up spectacular, highly polished, explosive action. Regrettably it comes at the price of a coherent story and rounded characterisations.\nThe story feels like it was made to accommodate the excess of exposition. Its a jumbled mess of poorly articulated ideas, that is, unsurprisingly, difficult to follow. Its not helped at all by an over abundance of peripheral characters. They simply add to the confused jumble and just as unsurprisingly, are never given the chance to display any depth of characterisation.\nThe results a film I personally found frustrating to watch. It boiled down to a series of action plot devices, including car chases and train wrecks. Certainly, some thought went into these sequences but because there is an absence of a solid story and believable characters, to cement the whole thing together, they don't amount to much, on their own.\nIn short, polished action but for me, lacks the key factors that bind any film together, including a decent story and characterisations. In short, I can't really recommend this one, in spite of being a fan of the franchise.""], ['90%', 'The Tom Cruise “Mission Impossible” franchise is one of reliable quality and equally dependable “forgettable-ness.” I’ve seen every film, yet my memory is fuzzy when I try to recall what happened in any of them. And while it’s almost a given that “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” will somehow sadly meet a similar fate, it’s still one of the best of the bunch. Not one thing disappointed me about this seventh installment in the series, an exciting and entertaining ride that gets almost everything right. This is an absolutely terrific action movie that overdelivers, and I loved every minute of it.\nWorld class field agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) works as a field agent for an elite, top-secret branch of the CIA called the IMF (Impossible Mission Force). His team, including associates Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) have become close friends, and they’re a well-oiled machine when working together. They regroup to embark on a dangerous mission to track down a new weapon that threatens all of humanity. The entire world is at stake, and Ethan must find a device before it falls into the wrong hands while dealing with some dark skeletons of his own past.\nIn order to get the most enjoyment out of the film, it’s best not to read too much about the plot. What works so well about the story is that it has a modern angle, and the motivations of the villains are extremely strong. The stakes are high and there’s a very real danger, which adds to the overall excitement. As one character puts it, they’re fighting “an enemy that’s everywhere and nowhere.” It’s smart, sophisticated, and polished in a way that tends to evade your typical summer blockbuster.\nThere are a few high tech, double cross, master of disguise elements, but they aren’t used as a distracting gimmick (as they sometimes have been in previous MI films). The high-concept action scenes are energetic and absolutely thrilling, making for some very clever and inventive spectacles. From a dramatic footrace through the canals of Venice to motorcycle jumps in the Austrian Alps to an epic car chase through the streets of Rome, there’s never a dull moment. There’s an inspired, extended sequence on a runaway train that will go down in history as one of the most creative and fun action scenes of the year, if not ever.\nThere are plenty of strong female characters in the story, including the new addition of Grace (Hayley Atwell), a crackerjack larcenist, and Paris (Pom Klementieff), a fierce bodyguard who gives off strong Harley Quinn vibes. This movie, simply put, is packed with badass women. Seeing the gang reunited is always fun, and Pegg and Rhames have created characters that feel like old friends. There’s excellent work from the supporting cast too (Vanessa Kirby, Esai Morales, and Shea Whigham). Cruise is starting to show his age, but he’s still one of Hollywood’s greatest working superstars. His performance is reliable, charismatic, and believable, which is exactly what it needs to be.\nIt’s clear that this is a movie that’s older and wiser and in turn, it’s made with more mature audiences in mind. Nothing is dumbed down, the emotional meter runs high, and the level of style and poise is unexpected and welcome (and to be commended). This is a classic espionage thriller that achieves a balance between artistry and pleasure, which is no easy feat.\n“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning” is the first part of a two part saga, but the finale isn’t so open-ended that it leads to frustration. Instead, it’s more of an excitement-based cliffhanger that’ll leave you salivating for the second half. This is a movie that could stand alone, but I’m awfully glad it doesn’t.'], ['80%', 'It was a good movie. Not better than the pervious one.

And for Cruise, he's at home as Ethan Hunt while the rest of the team had their moments.\nThe only drawback is some of the dialogue, especially during the intelligence agencies meeting, felt stilted probably because it was basically exposition dump.\nIt's not on the level of the past few movies but still entertaining, just had hoped the splitting of two movies thing was over and done with or at least was made justifiable (like Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame), which I'm not sure it is here. 3.75/5""], ['60%', 'This is the weakest M:I movie so far, which doesn\'t mean it\'s bad but it definitely has a few critical issues. The smaller issue is the pointless action sequences. This movie has a couple of overly long sequences that drag on for way too long and serve no purpose. They bring nothing new to the table in terms of stunts and don\'t add anything to the story. It\'s just padding and noise. However, the biggest issue is the plot about artificial intelligence. The filmmakers seem very insecure about the audience\'s ability to understand the themes used in the story. As a result, there are multiple long scenes where characters sit in a room and repeatedly speak about certain plot elements, in different levels of detail, as if they\'re trying to make sure the audience understands what they\'re talking about. I think ""rogue computer program"" is something that most people would understand, but the movie really tries to make this concept much deeper than it needs to be for the purpose of the movie, resulting in multiple needlessly complex exposition scenes. All of this to say that the movie could have been 30 minutes shorter if you could trim the pointless action sequences and the tech jargon. As it stands, Dead Reckoning Part Two is going to have to do some very heavy lifting in order to compensate for this bloated Part One.']]"

The film is directed by David Ayer, who has a knack for creating gritty and violent urban settings, and written by Kurt Wimmer, who has a penchant for crafting absurd and convoluted sci-fi scenarios. The result is a mashup of John Wick, The Equalizer, and The Matrix, with a dash of bee-related humor and symbolism.\nStatham plays Adam Clay, a reclusive beekeeper who lives on a farm owned by his elderly friend Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad). When Eloise falls victim to a phishing scam orchestrated by a sinister tech company, Adam decides to use his skills as a former elite operative to track down and punish the culprits.

He also forms an unlikely alliance with Eloise's daughter, FBI agent Sarah Parker (Emmy Raver-Lampman), who is investigating the same case.\nThe film does not waste much time on exposition or character development, focusing instead on the action sequences and the spectacle. Statham is in his element as the stoic and efficient killing machine, dispatching his foes with a variety of weapons and martial arts moves. He also delivers some witty and sarcastic remarks, often involving bees or honey. The supporting cast is mostly forgettable, except for Rashad, who brings some warmth and dignity to her role, and Rose, who plays the villain with a mix of charm and menace.\nThe film's biggest flaw is its lack of originality and coherence. The plot is a generic and predictable revenge story, with some implausible twists and turns. The film also tries to incorporate some themes and messages about technology, society, and morality, but they are either underdeveloped or contradictory. For example, the film seems to criticize the dangers of data mining and online fraud, but also glorifies the use of hacking and surveillance by the protagonist. The film also uses the bee motif as a metaphor for Adam's identity and mission, but it is often inconsistent and superficial.\nThe Beekeeper is not a film that will challenge or surprise you, but it is a film that will entertain you if you are in the mood for some mindless and fun action. It is a popcorn flick that knows its strengths and limitations, and delivers on its promise of Statham kicking ass and cracking jokes.

The plot isn’t deep, or complex, or intricate, or philosophical. but it’s there, and it makes sense. Just last year, John Wick showed us that you can get away with a pretty thin premise, if you work hard enough on building a thick, palpable world. And the world of Fury Road is something else entirely, I can see why people aren’t blown away by the story, but the world is incredible.\nThere has been much discussion as to whether Max himself, or his cohort Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron) is the star of the film. I would argue that neither of them are. Director George Miller is. This is his vision. Warner Brothers took a big risk when they handed a 70 year old man nearly two hundred million dollars to revitalise his franchise which has been dead for 30 years, then get out of the way and let him do his thing. But it paid off. Fury Road is more of an “experience” than most movies are, it just happens to be a great film, too.\nThe stunt work and visual effects deserve praise all to themselves. According to the filmmakers, roughly ten percent of all the effects were done with CGI. The other NINETY are practical, and it oozes with that spectacle. You really can feel the maximum force of the future sitting in that theatre, which is a rare and unexpected pleasure.\nIt’s my highest rated film of 2015 thus far, in fact, it’s one of only five films I’ve given more than 4 stars in the past five years. So please don’t take the recommendation lightly when I ask you all to go out and support this movie. Just make sure you do it in the biggest, best quality cinema you can, because this latest entry to the Mad Max franchise is worth it.\n91%\n-Gimly'], ['20%', '1 Star, solely for the fleeting Presence of the Interceptor. As for the rest, Nothing to do with Mad Max, just a cross country jaunt of constant silly action. \nAs a Fan of the Original, Mel Gibson is Mad Max, an there will be no other. I have no idea what was going through anyones mind when they tried to tie this to the Mad Max Franchise, Probably not much. If the movie had just been called Fury Road, left Mad Max out of it, It may have been an interesting movie in its owb right, but I think it would have been laughed at and relegated to the $1.99 bin at your local service station.'], ['100%', 'When I saw the reviews for this movie my first thought was ""Every critic has lost their minds... even me.""\nThe story is about a post-apocalyptic wasteland - the fight for survival has twisted the remnants of mankind, turning most into mad, vicious gangs. In this chaotic world two rebels may be able to restore order while seeking their own forms of redemption: Max, a man who just wants peace after losing his wife and child and Furiosa - who thinks finding her childhood home is the answer.\nWhat a lovely day to be talking about Mad Max: Fury Road, because the trailers and the reviews for this movie have been off the walls mad. I mean five out of five star\'s! wow, just wow. The last Mad Max film came out in 1985, so it\'s a been a long time and so was this movie, as development took a long time. So I was curious and a bit shady for this movie, by seeing if George Miller (The director of the original films) was going to bring to the table. Now after seeing the movie and having a long thought about it, this movie is freaking awesome, no actually this is the best action movie of the year and probably the decade.\nGeorge Miller goes back to his roots and he doesn\'t disappointment. After all these years later he\'s still got it. He filmed all the action scenes with care and effort, because most of the action in this movie are mostly practical effects and that right there shows that Miller is going back to old school of action, and it\'s perfect. You are the man Miller!\nThe movie itself is mad and I do mean freaking insane. There\'s a guy in this movie who plays a flamethrower electric guitar on top of a speed vehicle and all through out the movie he was rocking it out. I don\'t know why, but little things like that made this movie so mad that it\'s enjoyable.\nTom Hardy as Max Rockatansky was good, I mean he wasn\'t as good as Mel Gibson but I still think he did a great job. Most of the time Max doesn\'t talk all that much, I mean most of he\'s lines are ""huh"", or ""Water"", but he has a couple of lines in the movie and it sounded epic all the time.\nCharlize Theron (as Furiosa) is basically the main character and Max is the supporting character. Charlize Theron was like a female version of Max in a way, because her character steels the whole show as her character is a strong female bad-ass that kicks so much ass that it\'s very rare in action movies today to do that. Now think of all the strong female character\'s in past action movies, well that\'s Furiosa right here.\nThe action scenes can be best describe as incredible and freaking crazy. The stunt work used during the movie was f**king amazing. There actually used practical effects mixed with CGI during the action scenes which looked so good and much better than over using effect\'s to make something look incredible and I know they used some CGI for scenes where it needed it, because it would be too dangerous or impossible to do, but for the most part it\'s all practical effect\'s. NOW THIS IS HOW ACTION MOVIES SHOULD BE DONE! THANK YOU MAD MAX: FURY ROAD FOR DOING THIS!!! Okay, I had to get that out there and sorry for shouting.\nImmortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays- Byrne), and yes he was in the first Mad Max movie, but here he plays a different villain this time and a menacing one as well. He was like a mix of Dark Vader and Sweet Tooth from Twisted Metal (Video Game). He was awesome villain that didn\'t take sh*t from anyone and always looked like he was going to cause a whole lot of trouble every time he\'s on screen.\nThe cinematography was just beautiful and some of the best looking shoots so far this year. I can\'t believe I\'m saying that for a action movie that\'s been in development for years and it payed off perfectly. This is very rare for this to happen as a lot of movie franchises that have been in the making for years and years would normally come out to late where every body just lost interest and give up waiting, and the movie itself would turn out not so good, but here is much different. This movie broke new grounds of coming out late but still being a amazing thrill ride.\nThe other women in the movie know as the five wives are not just there to look pretty and be saved by any man, no they kicked ass in the movie and they actually did something. The five wives were strong women and this isn\'t just a mans movie, I mean most of the movie is the women kicking ass and being awesome. They kick more ass then Max ever did. That\'s why I got to give this movie praise for that.\nNow for the problems: I tried to look for things that didn\'t quite work for the movie and to be honest I couldn\'t find anything that I thought wasn\'t good. Well there was some slow parts in the movie but the slow parts where the action clams down for now it fills it\'s time with character development and back story and it worked.\nOverall rating: Forget ""Pitch Perfect 2"", this is the movie you should see at cinema. As a movie reviewer myself who wants action movies to be more then turn your brain off and enjoy whatever slob mess there in front of the screen, but what I want is a movie experience that I can look back on and say ""Now that, was one heck of a movie.""']]"

That\'s not the case here. This is a solid stand-alone story that doesn\'t require prior knowledge of anyone to get into it, and that serves it well. The animation is quickly paced and each character (even the dog) has a role to play as the adventure hots up.

In the end of the movie, there are too many open questions (and inconsistencies) in the plot.\nThe movie seems to end very abruptly without any decent climax, and many of the secondary characters that I expected would play an important role in the resolution of the conflicts, seem to have been completely forgotten.

Vampire powers are a myriad of random things. One time he is able to fly and it is hard to determine why exactly, the movie suggests because a subway train is pushing the air in front of it.

Of course, looking for the solution leads to the bigger story that you could probably guess by now.  I\'m also at a point where I\'m ""over it"" with a lot of these superhero movies, so it was refreshing to see something different out of the MCU.

After all, in this kind of movie we really do not need something fancy as long as it is not downright stupid. It only needs to be a vehicle for the action and special effects and for that purpose the story works fine.\nI like Morbius. He is intelligent and he doesn’t just sink down in some self pity or whining sessions when he finds out that things did not go exactly as planned. Sure, he is not happy about it but at least he does research into his condition and he actually takes the effort to learn what he can do with his new powers.\nI also do like the special effects and the action in general. The bad guy was rather predictable and not really very charismatic but he worked fairly okay. I think that most of the actors made a good enough job actually.\nIf I should complain about anything it was that scene in the beginning where they claimed that vampire bats could “finish off” big animals in minutes or something. That not what vampire bats do or how they feed. It is of course utter ignorant bull manure by some idiot script writer and it was really totally unnecessary to soil the movie with such nonsense already in the first scenes.

Instead of establishing everything the audience needs to know about the characters right at the beginning, he gradually develops them, giving them haunting backstories and spreading parts of it throughout the runtime. That said, this film isn\'t for everyone. The audience needs to trust Shyamalan and be patient. Really patient. Don\'t start taking notes about something that you think it\'s negative because once you reach the third act, everything changes and suddenly it all makes sense. The screenplay is not as twisty as Unbreakable, for example, but it demands absolute attention in order to catch up on all the things that matter (and the ones that don\'t, as well).\nThe production and editing team have to be congratulated due to their seamless work. From the camera work to the extended one-take sequences, as well as the environment surrounding the characters, everything feels real and looks amazing. The soundtrack ... Let me just say that this element is so, but so much relevant to the conclusion of this movie. I can\'t really say anything else without spoiling the ending, so I\'ll leave a note after my rating at the end of the review with a MAJOR SPOILER.\nAs for the cast, I\'ll start with the man that I honestly think should have received an Oscar nomination: James McAvoy. You know, there\'s a big difference in portraying a non-fiction character instead of a fiction one: concerning the former, you can\'t really escape the true nature of the person you are playing, but with the latter, as an actor/actress, you have to deliver yourself 100% to the role for it to be believable ... And God, does McAvoy deliver! He gives 200% in what could be his best performance to date. Do you think Andy Serkis had problems portraying both Gollum and Sméagol at the same time? Well, imagine 7 ... or 8 characters. I lost the count. All in all, James McAvoy, sir, congratulations! You are superb!\nAnya Taylor-Joy is also incredible as Casey! Her character has the most intriguing story of the three girls, and she\'s the one who assumes the leadership of the group once the kidnap occurs. Her initially unknown past helps her through the traumatic situation, but it\'s really her rather captivating backstory that grabbed my attention. It\'s fundamental to the understanding of the ending and Anya does a terrific job. I also want to give a small praise to Betty Buckley for a beautiful and necessary interpretation of Dr. Fletcher, a character that offers the audience some knowledge of Kevin\'s disease.\nAs for the other two kidnapped girls, well ... They\'re my main issue with the film since they don’t have a good reason to be there. Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) aren\'t the main characters, and they don\'t have that much screen time, but their dialogue still feels extremely forced and filled with a lot of nonsense. The ending of the story might not be as twisty as in other Shyamalan\'s installments, but I hope that people don\'t give up to false expectations. The classic Shyamalan\'s twisty ending isn\'t a necessary attribute of his movies, but the truth is that the twist is not the one you think it is. Once again, the note at the end of my review will clarify this.\nIn the end, Split is Shyamalan\'s return to his old early 2000\'s self. Brilliantly unconventional storytelling, a lot of suspense, some very captivating subplots and a fantastic editing and production team behind him. The soundtrack plays a huge role in this film, as well as James McAvoy, who delivers his career-best performance. Anya Taylor-Joy is also pretty extraordinary, something that can\'t be said about her fellow friends who portrayed two bland characters. The ending brings the classic twist that makes everything more understandable, and I gotta say ... I love this film, and it is one of 2017\'s best!\nMAJOR SPOILER BELOW\nAs I said above, the soundtrack plays a huge role in the ending twist. That\'s because the soundtrack that plays right before the title of the movie appears on the screen, is the same one as in the third act of Unbreakable.\nThis is one of the many clues throughout the film that hint at the idea that Split belongs to Unbreakable\'s universe. Naturally, after the title shows up, there\'s a scene with David Dunn (Bruce Willis) that confirms this theory, but these are little details that make Shyamalan into a great director and screenwriter. Also, it\'s a pity that I\'ve only watched these movies after Shyamalan stating that they were part of an eventual trilogy. Not that I was not surprised at the end of Split, but it did remove that first impact of pure shock in knowing that two films separated by 17 years (in real life) are part of the same universe.\nBoth movies end up falling into the ""superhero"" genre. Unbreakable is the story of our ""hero"" who spent his whole life sad because he wasn\'t doing ""what he was supposed to do"", and Split is an origin story of our ""villain"". If Glass delivers, this might be one of the best “superhero” trilogies ever.\nRating: A'], ['70%', ""You like to make fun of us, but we are more powerful than you think.\nSplit is written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It stars James McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy, Betty Buckley, Haley Lu-Richardson and Jessica Sula. Music is by West Dylan Thordson and cinematography by Mike Gioulakis.\nThree girls are kidnapped by a man with a diagnosed 23 different personalities. They must try to escape before the apparent emergence of the 24th - known as The Beast...\nWe now know that Split is the second instalment of a trilogy by Shyamalan that began with Unbreakable and is ending with Glass (released 2019). Always proving to be a most divisive director/writer/actor, Shyamalan has returned to the sort of noticeable form that had him earmarked in his early days as a director to follow - with the proviso that inevitably this is going to still infuriate some for its handling of the subjects at hand.\nThe plot trajectory is simple enough, girls kidnapped by a patient suffering from multiple personality disorder, as the girls in fear try to escape, a number of his personalities put in an appearance. Which builds up to the finale, which explodes after following on from the suspense and dread atmospherics so beloved by the director. In the mix joining the mental health issue with our main protagonist is a good meaning doctor (naturally), and the spectre of child abuse rears its ugly head. So not a movie to be cheered up by then! While if looking for a detailed and attentive look at the mental health issues to hand you will be disappointed.\nHowever, there is a style to the picture in how it draws you into the predicament of the main players, boosted no end by McAvoy on irresistible form. Given licence to chew every scene, he delivers his various characters with great relish and no little amount of skill. Props to for Taylor-Joy, who as the lead kidnappee has deftly blended youthful innocence with resourceful strength (aided by Shyamalan's writing of course). Conversely, Shyamalan is guilty of just making a pic for entertainment purpose, which works as it's a very good creepy thriller with its black humour moments, but the mental health plot devices ensure his gimmicks will not be welcomed by all. 7/10""]]"

Hence, you know how much I absolutely love that movie. A low-budget, high-concept horror flick that surprised everyone, including myself, ultimately becoming one of the very best films of the respective year, as well as one of the best original horror stories in the last couple of decades. Now, I acknowledge that John Krasinski created something that could very well turn out to be the ""next big thing"" when it comes to horror franchises. However, that doesn\'t mean I support that endeavor. Artistically, I would much rather prefer for this to be a one-off, but I know better than anyone that if an original movie is tremendously successful at the box office - especially one that requires a short amount of money to make - sequel talks will obviously emerge.\nMy only major issue with the first film was, in fact, its ending. It\'s an admittedly badass conclusion, but it also felt like a cry to Hollywood in order to extend the story. I didn\'t expect this type of ending for such a character-driven personal project, but in all honesty, I rather have a sequel to A Quiet Place than the 10th SAW film or the continuation of the never-ending Fast & Furious saga. With that said, my expectations were still pretty high due to Krasinski\'s even more impactful involvement in the movie. With sole screenwriting credit and only possessing a few minutes of screentime this time around, Krasinski gets more time to focus on his primary technical role, delivering, once again, a masterfully directed film.\nI find A Quiet Place Part II inferior to its predecessor in many ways, but the extreme levels of suspense generated by Krasinski\'s flawless direction are still the highlight of this saga. The beautifully shot opening sequence (cinematography by Polly Morgan) sets up the incredibly high level of tension for the subsequent monster scenes, all requiring the viewers to hold their breath for several minutes. These nerve-wracking moments are elevated by terrific acting performances across the board - I\'ll get there - but Krasinski demonstrates exquisite knowledge of the art of filmmaking, using his best attributes in favor of the movie. Boasting a nail-biting atmosphere and effective jumpscares, the characters find a few imaginative evasion maneuvers to avoid the monsters.\nHowever, this leads me to one of my main issues with this sequel. The first film establishes the creatures in its ruthless, merciless first few minutes, where it becomes clear that if someone makes the tiniest noise and if a monster is nearby, they\'re dead. There\'s a minimal chance of survival, and the emotionally resonant ending also attests to this fundamental, lethal aspect of the whole ""sound-hunting beasts"" concept. Nevertheless, during the entire runtime of the sequel, including the phenomenal opening, it\'s like we\'re witnessing different monsters. If the first movie already had a couple of logic-related issues, this sequel increases the number of personal nitpicks.\nPeople can run away quite a bit before the creatures get close - so much that I firmly believed the film would go back to the opening sequence to explain how the main characters managed to escape a specific attack. Protagonists survive absurdly improbable situations due to heavy plot armor. Even a couple of character/plot decisions are questionable, to say the least, particularly the trigger that sets up the third act. After the first movie, where everything feels surprisingly grounded and far from nonsensical, jumping to the continuation of the same story and having to disconnect our brain continuously is a bit disappointing, especially since the screenplay remains incredibly focused on the characters.\nAlmost every element in this film feels less emotionally impactful than the original, but it\'s far from being a massive letdown. In fact, having in mind the competition in the genre, A Quiet Place Part II might even be one of the best horror sequels ever for all I know. Firstly, the actors are absolutely magnificent. Emily Blunt (Evelyn) and Cillian Murphy - who I didn\'t expect to have that much importance and screentime as he has - bring their experience to a movie where the young actors are the ones who truly shine. Noah Jupe (Marcus) and Millicent Simmonds (Regan) steal the spotlight from the more renowned colleagues, delivering impressive performances that will surely guarantee them several award nominations by the end of the year.\nThe focus on deeply exploring the characters strengthens the emotional connection with the viewers, making every scene carry a certain gravitas. Ethical dilemmas are beautifully tackled through Murphy\'s character, Emmett, who creates an unexpected bond with Regan. The latter stands out as a brave, smart, altruist deaf girl who should inspire many people worldwide - it\'s worth remembering that Simmonds, a real-life deaf girl, brings outstanding authenticity to her role. Just like the original film, most dialogues contain sign language, so the narrative is also developed through visual storytelling. Once again, Krasinski knows perfectly when and how to tell the audience something exclusively through the camera, many times just pure silence, keeping the viewers\' attention on the screen at all times.\nThroughout the sequel, there are various visual nods and callbacks to the first flick that I also appreciated quite a lot, such as a certain object on a shelf or a repeated sentence. The ending carries less emotional weight than the original\'s brutal final minutes, but the entire last act will go down as one of the most impeccably edited conclusions of the year. Michael P. Shawver needs to cross-cut between excruciatingly tense sequences on completely different locations with important characters facing the same level of danger. The action is displayed seamlessly, letting the viewers genuinely enjoy the last moments of the movie without annoyingly choppy editing. Marco Beltrami\'s score is really gripping during the entirety of these last few scenes.\nA Quiet Place Part II feels less than its predecessor in almost every element, but it\'s still one of the best sequels of the genre. From the riveting, frenetic opening sequence - much of it shot in long, uncut takes - to one of the most impressively edited endings I\'ve seen in years, John Krasinski maintains an incredibly tense, suspenseful atmosphere throughout the entire runtime, something that\'s becoming a trademark of his directing career. Story-wise, the characters continue to be the main focus of the narrative. Boasting emotional dilemmas and bold character development, the kids have a surprising impact on the overall screenplay. Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt are remarkable, but Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds are astonishing, especially the latter. However, the monsters are depicted in a much less threatening, lethal manner, leading to many questionable plot decisions, as well as absurd survival situations. In addition to this, the world-building lacks significant revelations and creative ideas. Overall, it\'s a less emotionally resonant film than the original, which doesn\'t exactly let me down, but I did expect more from this sequel. Still, I highly recommend watching it at the theater.

The situations people need to be rescued from are just as ridiculous and far-fetched and the main plot here gets far more convoluted and hackneyed than the average day of any real lifeguard.\nAnd like 21 Jump Street and a bunch of lesser TV to movie adaptations, this seeks to make fun of all of it, plus all the slo-mo beach running. Does it come off as good as Jump Street? No. Do we need this? God no.

Now a film, possibly a new franchise if it all goes well. There were lots of expectations on it, but the film did not deliver that.

Clearly, no one in the production team cared about this movie. Now, after watching the film, it\'s pretty easy to understand the reasons behind the constant delays, and the poor marketing campaign (I barely saw anything remotely publicizing this movie). It\'s not a complete disaster, it\'s not an absolute mess, but the third act is such a stab into the fans\' hearts. Literally, one of the most abrupt endings of the last few years. It really feels like a producer entered the writers\' room and said something along the lines of ""let\'s just hurry this up, Marvel Cinematic Universe is right around the corner, nothing of what we do here matters.""\nI\'m not going to lie, it\'s actually true. No matter how amazing or horrible this film ended up to be, it wouldn\'t really matter, which is probably the most negative aspect of this Disney-Fox merger. Days Of Future Past is arguably one of the better X-Men installments, but Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix feel such a waste of time because they never really explore what the time-travel event really changed, and now time\'s up, a complete reboot is coming. The first act of this movie is genuinely remarkable. I felt invested in both the story and characters, I was deeply captivated by what they were doing, and Hans Zimmer\'s score elevates a specific sequence that on IMAX really shows off both the visual and audio\'s phenomenal quality.\nUntil midway through, it\'s a pretty well-written, well-performed, and exciting film (with occasional minor issues). However, after a risky yet convincing plot point, Simon Kinberg annihilates everything he was working on until then. From this moment on, I can feel the famous merger being signed, and everyone working on this movie just giving up. The writing becomes atrocious, one of the most forgettable and nonsensical villains ever shows up (and I thought that comic-book adaptations were working past the cliche ""bad guys""), characters like Quiksilver are barely in the film (why set up his relationship with his father if they never approach that subplot again?), and the ending lasts around three minutes. Three. In this amount of time, they do the equivalent of the last hour of Avengers: Endgame. Now, try to imagine that epic hour of climactic battles crushed into a couple of minutes...\nThe cast truly tries. Sophie Turner carries this movie with such an emotionally powerful performance that I almost feel that she alone deserved a positive review. James McAvoy (Professor Charles Xavier) continues his streak of gripping displays (if he doesn\'t get a freaking Oscar in the next years, I\'ll explode), Michael Fassbender is splendid as Magneto, and Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique) doesn\'t do much. Nicholas Hoult (Beast) is a pleasant surprise, but Jessica Chastain (Smith) is the only one at fault here. I never felt any interest from the actress in getting into a superhero film, and honestly, it shows. She\'s definitely the one that couldn\'t care less about what comes out of this, so she just offers a one-dimensional performance for a pretty lousy villain.\nThe screenplay is filled with characters making uncharacteristic decisions (they feel unearned), and exposition scenes that don\'t really do justice to the compelling backstories. Nevertheless, I always feel the need to come back to the ending. I rather have a slow start, but a strong finish than the other way around. Dark Phoenix delivers a fast-paced, entertaining, and captivating first act, but slowly starts to degrade until it culminates with one of the saga\'s worst third acts. Sure, the action is great, and it\'s quite well-filmed actually, but it all ends so quickly that you don\'t have enough time even to try to enjoy it. If it wasn\'t for Hans Zimmer\'s score, which completely nailed me to the screen, my brain would have shut itself down before the wrap-up.\nIt\'s a shame that such a beloved franchise like the X-Men has to end like this. Simon Kinberg, knowing that the merger was going to happen, should have changed the last half, and risk a lot more, to be honest. If the movie really didn\'t matter, then they should have tried to do something that was never done before, and go all-out. If it fails, it fails, but at least it would have been remembered as a courageous and powerful film. This way, not only it\'s a disappointing culmination to a 20-year saga, but it\'s forgettable. It\'s not even horrible enough for people to remember how bad it was, it\'s just ... Meh. If they didn\'t care, how can they ask the audience to do it for them?\nAll in all, Dark Phoenix ends up being what everyone feared it would be: a movie that didn\'t matter, at all. One that didn\'t even try to pay homage to an extraordinary saga that notably influenced the comic-book genre. The worst of all is that everyone can imagine how great it could have been since the cast is perfect (Sophie Turner shines), Hans Zimmer\'s score is sumptuous, and the action is riveting. The worst feeling that a fan can have is that disappointment with how the film turned out to be mixed with the frustration due to how well a fan can imagine how amazing it could have been. However, a flawed narrative with a terrible villain and questionable character decisions ruins those dreams. With one of the most abrupt endings of the last years, X-Men reaches its end as an isolated franchise, and it now rests its hopes on Kevin Feige and Marvel co. that the MCU will do the mutants justice.\nPS: as you know, I try to avoid trailers as much as I can. After watching Dark Phoenix\'s ones, I can only advise you to not watch a single one. Not even the first one. Especially that first one!

Both the opening scene where the X-Men rescue astronauts stranded in space and the ending where Magneto and the X-Men fight aliens on a train were well done action scenes. It's the middle that sags a bit. The film lacks energy and emotional impact. Simon Kinberg wrote and directed this second go around of the Phoenix Saga as a way to atone for writing the mediocre The Last Stand. But this film does not really improve on that film at all. I am eager to see Kevin Feige cover the full Phoenix Saga properly in a trilogy. You cannot cram the Phoenix story into one movie. We've barely gotten to know these young versions of these characters from Apocalypse. The worst performance is from Jennifer Lawrence, whose Raven is completely smug and obnoxious towards Prof. X. I was happy when she exited the movie. You can tell she doesn't care about this franchise at all. Beast acts completely out of character and joins Magneto to kill Jean--something he would never do. Quicksilver exits the movie quickly after being injured by Jean and only returns at the very end. His relationship with his father, Magneto, is never addressed. Scott Summers takes orders from Mystique (ugh!) and never shows any leadership abilities. The villains are generic evil aliens who want to use the Phoenix Force to take over the world. They are just bargain basement Skrulls. Then there are the usual continuity errors with other X-Men movies. Apocalypse showed that Phoenix was a part of Jean, just like The Last Stand did. Now we are told that the Phoenix lives outside of Jean and comes from outer space. Also, when you see how things end for Prof. X and Jean in this movie, it's unlikely that either of them would appear at the end of Days of Future Past to greet Logan at the school.

That movie was good up until the last act with the conventional battle between the good and bad mutants at Alcatraz Island, which diverged from the more interesting core story concerning Jean. “Dark Phoenix” (2019) has a similar problem in that Jean’s inner  conflict between good and evil is the most interesting element, along with the other mutants being troubled by her transformation  and trying to figure out how to handle it.\nUnfortunately, as with “X-Men 3,” the filmmakers insist on having everything come down to a big battle sequence that’s overlong and predictable, although it’s better and more moving here. A good example of predictableness is when Magneto (Michael Fassbender) utilizes many rifles to shoot Vuk (Jessica Chastain); you know very well that the bullets are going to be totally useless. The ending’s not bad, just tedious and perfunctory, similar to the big battle sequence in “Avengers: Endgame,” albeit less dull. The original climax of “Dark Phoenix” took place in space and had too many similarities to “Captain Marvel,” which beat “Dark Phoenix” to the theaters. So the creators had to reshoot the ending as a battle sequence involving a train, but it didn’t feel tacked on or inorganic, although the Juk/aliens subplot did.\nI prefer Sophie Turner to Famke Janssen in the titular role. She’s just an all-around pleasure to behold, although acting-wise she’s not yet up to the caliber of Fassbender, James McAvoy (Xavier) or Jennifer Lawrence (Raven), not even close. In any case, I found the Phoenix story fascinating just as I did with “The Last Stand,” but here it’s more fleshed out, which makes it better in some ways. I just wish the creators would have the gonads to do something fresh rather than strap the conventional “big battle” ending on what could have been a great movie.\nIf you liked “First Class” (2011), “Days of Future Past” (2014) and “Apocalypse” (2016), “Dark Phoenix” is cut from the same cloth in all-around quality. I prefer “Days” and “Apocalypse,” but “Dark Phoenix” ain’t no slouch, despite what detractors might say; and it’s superior to “First Class.”\nThe film runs 1 hour, 53 minutes.\nGRADE: B+'], ['30%', 'I don\'t know if Dark Phoenix is the worst entry in the X-Men franchise.

The characters are doing a decent enough job of their roles although none of them are really up to the standard Patrick Stewart brought to the franchise.\nThe biggest gripe I have with the movie is it’s incessant whining. Jean is quite cool when she get’s pissed off and shows off her powers pretty much stopping anything that gets thrown at her. However those good moments are overshadowed by both her and other characters going into whining mode every so often. And Hank is just a bloody annoying asshole.\nI haven’t really read that many X-Men comics (didn’t have them in Sweden when I grew up) so I cannot say I know much about Jean’s real story in those. I noticed that a lot of people complained about the story in the movie not being “the right” one. Sure, when they take a known character and remakes him for no good reason that pisses me off as well but this is NOT a one star movie by any stretch of the imagination.\nOverall I cannot say that I really felt disappointed having watched it.

It's a shame they didn't do the true story of dark Phoenix because that would have been a good movie. I thought at the end of apocalypse when you see the Phoenix rise from out of Jean you would get that in this movie but it seems that whoever wrote the script and whoever directed this decided that the stupid teeny angst bullcrap was more important than the true story of who dark Phoenix was.

What many of them don't realise is that Alex Proyas has already made that movie. More than a cult film yet still criminally ignored in certain circles, Dark City, by way of poor box office and studio interference, never got off to the best of starts. The problems were compounded with the release of The Matrix the following year, where that film's popularity, and its sci-fi linkage to Dark City, led many to think that Proyas' movie was a Matrix rip-off; pushing it further (unjustly) back in the sci-fi noir pantheon. Fact is is that Dark City homages much great cinema from previous years, but it has influenced much that followed, with Inception fans asked to note that Nolan himself was taking notes...\nStolen Memories.\nDark City is a feverish film noir dressed up in stunning sci-fi clothes. The amazing visuals have led many to state that it's a film with much style and little substance, something which Proyas has fiercely argued against; and he's right to do so, especially once his own preferred director's cut became available to view. The story is a complex one, pulsing with human characters living in a world where there is no daylight, with their respective memories scratchy to say the least, it quickly becomes evident that a creepy alien race are overseeing things. The aliens, wonderfully attired in black trench-coats and hats to match, and aided by Kiefer Sutherland's shifty - stammer affected - doctor, have special powers and their reasons for being here unfold in deftly constructed stages.

Murdoch in his confused state is not only at the center of an existential dilemma, he's also the focal point for a serial killer murder investigation. This also as he tries to come to terms with matters of the heart, it seems he has a beautiful wife (Connelly), and that she may have cheated on him? And why is he drawn to the place known as Shell Beach? A simple narrative hidden by visual splendours? Don't make me laugh! But hell you have to say the visual look and atmosphere of the design is very much attention grabbing.\nI have become the monster you were intended to be.\nWith the film noir characters in place; Hurt's dour sleuth, Sewell's amnesiac and Connelly's sultry torch singer, Proyas brings German expressionism in abundance whilst overseeing an eye splintering neo-noir colour palette. Greens and reds often ping from the screen, while the murky browns and golds down on the angular city streets pave the way for changed perceptions and revelations of plotting. There are reoccurring motifs throughout, with swirls and circles integral to mood and meanings, while at the mid-point we then get to see Proyas' tricks of the trade, where the city shifts and moves to create a meeting of Metropolis and Gotham, all as the humans slumber away. Watch those clocks folks...\nYou know how I was supposed to feel. That person isn't me... never was. You wanted to know what it was about us that made us human.

Several people seek him in the ensuing night hours of the big city: a somewhat mad doctor (Kiefer Sutherland), a detective (William Hurt), his estranged wife (Jennifer Connelly), an alluring woman of the night (Melissa George) and a group of pale bald males in black trench coats. He tries to piece together reality and escape the perpetually dark city.\nAlex Proyas\' ""Dark City"" (1998) takes place entirely on elaborate shadowy sets with CGI backgrounds, etc. The first time I tried to watch it I gave up after 20 minutes. But, if you\'re in the right mode, it\'s a cool sci-fi flick with elements of film noir and mystery/horror that is thought-provoking and never devolves into predictable blockbuster dreck.\nThe revelations at the end are well done. In addition, Sewell makes for a top-rate protagonist and William Hurt is effective. Many complain about Kiefer\'s offbeat performance, but the role called for it. If you don\'t like it blame the writers.\nOn the female front you have Jennifer Connelly when she was still curvy and ravishing (by the early 2000s she lost too much weight and thus her alluring appeal). Meanwhile Melissa George is gorgeous in her small role as a call girl.\nMy interest in ""Dark City"" was spurred by Roger Ebert\'s exuberant accolades. He was so impressed by the illusion of the vast scope of the city, which can be attributed to the well-done CGI backgrounds and accouterments beyond the immediate exemplary sets. Of course, this is no big deal today, but at the time it was still fairly new technology.\nSome people compare ""Dark City"" to the more popular ""The Matrix"" and for good reason since they have similar themes and ""The Matrix"" was actually shot on some of the same sets, but that one came out over a year later in 1999. There are also similarities to ""Gattaca,"" which debuted 4.5 months earlier in late 1997.\n""The Matrix"" went on to mega-success at the box office while ""Dark City"" floundered despite its brilliant bits. Why? For me, the characters needed fleshed-out more with increased human interest. There\'s some, for sure, but not enough. As such, audiences in general found the film odd, perplexing and uncompelling. However, sci-fi aficionados should eat it up.\nIt\'s superior to ""Gattaca,"" but not as as good as ""The Matrix.""\nThe film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes, and the Director\'s Cut 1 minute longer; it was shot on sets in Sydney, Australia.\nGRADE: B-/B']]"

That\'s the general opinion of this movie, and I agree that it is a great movie, but I have seen better movies.\nThe story of Citizen Kane is simple, a newspaper tycoon named Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) dies, and his last word is ""Rosebud"". No one knows what it means, and a reporter starts interviewing people Kane knew, to see if they know the meaning of ""Rosebud"". Through flash-backs we get to see Kane\'s life.\nNow, as I said, I don\'t agree that it\'s the greatest movie of all time, however it\'s great. I love this movie. It\'s a daring and controversial movie of its time, and it introduced alot of new technices in filmmaking. The acting is superb! Orson Welles as Kane is breathtaking, Joseph Cotten as Jed Leland is great. There\'s one performance I can hardly stand though and that\'s Dorothy Comingore\'s performance as Susan Alexander. Hideous performance to say the least! The writing is amazing, and Welles\' directing is out-of-this-world!\nIn conclusion, great movie (however not the greatest ever made). It\'s definitly a movie you need to watch!\nI give it a 9/10'], ['100%', ""I fondly recollect, growing up in Canada in the 70's and 80's, my mom taking my older sister and I to the cinema (my dad was more interested in watching bowling, hockey, or either crime shows, British sitcoms or hockey on TV). Despite all of his TV appearances over the years, and films he acted in to fund his own productions, the first time I was aware of Orson Welles was one of those startling and bizarrely professional yet unmistakably charismatic 'Paul Masson' wine commercials that they tend to make fun of on The Simpsons in these decades gone by. My first thought was 'that voice is amazing', then 'he looks like he'd be a fine grandfather or Santa Claus', and I instantly wanted to know who he was: Just the way he carried himself, I knew he must be both brilliant and someone who was really important.\nAs you can tell, I'm not going to unnecessarily repeat all the endless accolades this film has gotten over the years. If you're any type of film lover, you have either seen this or will eventually--unless you're hit by a bus tomorrow (Heaven forbid) or something else drastic. It's a hallmark of what is possible in cinema. I waited until I was 46 to see this, because of its stellar reputation. It's not my favourite Welles--either acting or directing, and not by a long shot in either regard--but I'm very glad that I finally saw it, and I'll probably revisit it every couple of years for the rest of my life. There's just something really special about it that's hardly ever seen any more--and I think of that just as wistfully as Charles Foster Kane did about his beloved 'Rosebud'. That a 25-year-old could be so gleefully and breathtakingly experimental and innovative, yet still endlessly entertain, is nothing short of miraculous.""], ['100%', 'If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\nThe ""greatest film of all-time"", everyone declares. I\'ve been revisiting David Fincher\'s career this last week since he\'s in charge of directing the upcoming Mank, which premise approaches the story behind Citizen Kane\'s screenplay credit controversy back in 1941. Herman J. Mankiewicz unquestionably helped Orson Welles writing the script for this movie, but if that contribution was enough to warrant his name on the film\'s credits, well... Apparently, it was settled that Mankiewicz (known as Mank) did indeed deserve that recognition since I just had to write his name on the ""written by"" section above. Nevertheless, this review doesn\'t concern that external issue, but yes, the most globally acclaimed movie in cinema\'s history.\nI always defend that someone\'s opinion about a film is as valid as everyone else\'s. Unless the arguments used are disrespectful, reductive comments such as the cliche ""it\'s just boring"" or the externally influenced ""I don\'t like that actor in real life, hence the movie is awful"", I\'m always ready to discuss a film with anyone who shows respect for the respective flick. There\'s an interesting question people keep asking me: ""should I watch this old movie that everyone talks about? It\'s just that..."" and usually they linger around here. Probably, afraid of saying something like ""it\'s still in black-and-white"" or ""its visuals are so old-fashioned"". This is a pretty common behavior in the entertainment realm that is film watching.\nI always reply back with another question: ""if you love movies, why wouldn\'t you want to watch such a highly acclaimed film, no matter how old it is?"" And, again, people hesitate because they\'ve never asked themselves this. They\'re afraid that their ""discrimination"" against old movies might affect their overall opinion about them, and then be in that complicated position that is being in a very small minority. If there\'s something time didn\'t change is that people still don\'t know how to behave when they\'re part of a little group with an unpopular opinion. Some follow the offense route, attacking anyone who disagrees with them. Others create conspiracy theories, saying that most people think otherwise because they followed the herd, not possessing a genuine, personal opinion.\nIf you love the art of filmmaking, if you enjoy going to the film theater, then watching older movies will only improve upon that passion. However, there\'s a certain responsibility that the viewer should always have. As a spectator, we must always be able to place ourselves in the adequate period. We can\'t watch a 1941\'s film with the cultural, technological, social rules, and mentality of 2020. It would be extremely unfair to these movies since our enjoyment will be affected by modern political views, religious perspectives, and historical differences. We will look at a film like Citizen Kane, and deceivingly think: ""I don\'t see anything remotely new or innovative in any shape or form"".\nThis leads me to a suggestion I always give every movie lover like me. It doesn\'t matter too much if you do this before or after the actual viewing of an ""old film"", but do a quick research on its impact on filmmaking and our culture. Understand why or what makes the movie so special. Learn what to look out for when watching the film, and adjust your knowledge of everything to the year of release. Try imagining yourself as a person living in that year, leaving home to go to the closest movie theater, and sitting in your favorite spot to watch a new motion picture. If you\'re able to do all of this, then there\'s absolutely no way of not acknowledging the unprecedented, groundbreaking, historically impactful Citizen Kane.\nStill to this day, film critics get that childish, ignorant judgment of ""critics don\'t know how to have fun, they only value artsy stuff that no one cares about"". I\'m not going to enter a debate about this, otherwise, I\'d have to write an essay, but I will address that last part. The ""artsy stuff"" is what movies are made of. Without the artists behind each technical component, we wouldn\'t evolve to the point of getting the visually mind-blowing films we receive every month. Well, Citizen Kane impacted every single piece of cinema and shaped the filmmaking industry. People complain about directors not being able to share their original vision in 2020? Try making a movie 80 years ago, where studios were always responsible for the final cut.\nOrson Welles changed that process, and much, much more. From the original marketing campaign (it was the first time a trailer didn\'t contain a single shot from the actual film) to the inventive storytelling structure, there\'s no denying that the groundbreaking technical aspects transformed filmmaking forever. At the time, ceilings weren\'t shown, hand-held cameras were unheard of, the lighting had strict rules, and unconventional angles weren\'t used. Gregg Toland\'s cinematography changed all of that and tremendously influenced how movies are made today. His experimental methods gave rise to the imaginative use of ""deep focus"", where the camera shows the foreground, background, and everything in between, all in sharp focus.\nToland was so crucial for the success of Citizen Kane that Welles decided to share the credits spotlight with him. Vernon L. Walker, as the VFX supervisor, employed techniques so impressive that just a few months ago, we had the famous Corridor Crew VFX team breakdown a particular sequence, and most of them didn\'t know how Walker did it. The latter was a pioneer in shooting massive crowds and wide interior places. Robert Wise\'s editing is the main component in the famous breakfast montage, by creating a sequence in the exact same location while the actors change their clothes and make-up between cuts, giving the feel of time passing by even though the set design is still the same\nIn every other technical component, innovation is the keyword. Bailey Fesler and James G. Stewart employed rarely used radio techniques to simulate crowd noise and singing. Bernard Herrmann composed an unconventional score due to its pauses and short bits of soundtrack, something utterly different from the typical non-stop music of Hollywood films. Finally, Mankiewicz and Welles\' screenplay. Its structure based on flashbacks and a nonlinear timeline was unique at the time. It\'s probably why the movie doesn\'t feel as old as other films when watching it today. Citizen Kane is decades ahead of its time, technically and story-wise. And its ending... still as powerful and jaw-dropping as in the first time I saw it.\nIt became the most influential movie in the history of cinema. It\'s constantly at the top of many ""best films of all-time"" lists, and it\'s still the number one movie for several critics. Orson Welles\' film is probably the movie with the most amount of hype one ever got, to the point of making people afraid of even saying that ""it\'s fine"", let alone dislike it. If you think Citizen Kane is a bit boring or that the actors aren\'t that good or even if you weren\'t surprised by anything... you\'re far from being alone. People talk about this film like it\'s a once-in-a-lifetime experience, a movie that will take people to Mars or to another galaxy. It\'s understandable if many viewers simply don\'t find any of the phenomenal qualities that everyone talks about.\nThe fact that most of the film is astonishingly innovative doesn\'t take away the other fact that it\'s still a movie from 1941. If it was released today (with all the natural modifications), most people would find it a very well-directed film, technically exceptional, and possessing a quite remarkable character-study. It doesn\'t mean it has to resonate with everyone. There\'s no movie in history loved or hated by everyone, and there will never be one. I don\'t ask you to learn to love Citizen Kane. I ask you to comprehend its legacy, background, and undeniable impact on filmmaking and our culture. Almost every film we see on massive IMAXs today, we owe that to Orson Welles and his visionary production.\n80 years after its release, Citizen Kane continues to be addressed by many as ""the greatest movie ever made"". It became the most popular film of all-time, one that went through decades of in-depth essays. Everything that needed to be said about it has already been stated, recorded, and written. No movie warrants higher expectations from its viewers, but this massive hype makes it a dangerous film. People fear being judged for not understanding the worldwide acclaim or simply disliking it. Is it a tad boring? Are some actors flat? Is the story not as mesmerizing and memorable as you\'d expect? Don\'t be afraid to say ""yes"" because all of these opinions are entirely reasonable. None of this contradicts the indisputable influence it had on filmmaking and in the history of cinema. Everything about this movie\'s production and origin, the precedent-setting technical aspects, and the innovative storytelling all prove that Orson Welles was a perfectionist filmmaker far ahead of its time. Is it the best film ever? That\'s a never-ending debate I don\'t wish to be a part of. But it\'s undeniably one of the most magnificent masterpieces of cinema, one that every movie lover must watch.\nRating: A+'], ['90%', ""Outstanding film, no question.\n'Citizen Kane', at least to me, feels like such a unique film in terms of how it is brought to life - I don't recall seeing anything that exactly matches it in that regard.

The score is terrific and the performances from the cast are excellent.\nOrson Welles, the director too of course, is perfect for the titular role. He is sensational, it must be said. He makes Charles Foster Kane absolutely fascinating, despite the questionable nature of the character. I basically enjoyed everyone else who came onscreen, the more memorable ones being Joseph Cotten (Jedediah) and Dorothy Comingore (Susan) - George Coulouris (Thatcher) has a few amusing moments, also.\nThe editing and pacing are two other things that impressed me, as did the fantastic News on the March opening.

It’s regarded as “the greatest movie ever made” by many respectable people and was, for instance, Roger Ebert’s favorite film.\nCharles Foster Kane and his magnificent homestead Xanadu were inspired by media barons like William Randolph Hearst and his never-completed Hearst Castle. The concept naturally brings to mind Elvis and Graceland, Michael Jackson and Neverland, and Donald Trump and Trump Tower (or whatever).\nOn a filmmaking level there’s a lot to appreciate, including techniques that were fresh at the time of its release, such as unusual camera angles, lens distortion and the creative use of flashbacks. Up to that point in film history, for instance, ceilings were never shown because that’s where the mics were located, but Welles included myriad scenes from low angles with the ceiling obvious in the background.\nThen there are the interesting interpretations, including the two main ones, which seemingly contradict: The enigma view suggests that the nature of a person is ultimately a mystery based on numerous subjective truths of different people’s perspectives whereas the rosebud interpretation proposes that a person’s life can ultimately be figured out based on a key clue. In Kane’s case, the clue is linked to lost innocence, the comfort of childhood, a mother’s love and the lack of responsibilities thereof.\nAs far as entertainment goes, the flick starts with vigor and features some highlights (e.g. the lively dancing sequence, Kane’s political ambitions and the hollow halls of Xanadu) and human interest (e.g. Kane’s relationship with the amateur opera singer), but I found it unengaging too often. I simply didn’t find Kane a fascinating enough character and therefore didn’t ‘get’ the obsession with interpreting his life. Still, I wouldn\'t call this ""Citizen Suck.""\nFor greatest movies ever made I’ll go with flicks like “Apocalypse Now,” “Runaway Train,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” “Dead Poets Society,” “The Mothman Prophecies,” “Watchmen,” “The Green Mile,” “Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,” “Dances with Wolves,” “The Horse Whisperer,” “Lucy,” “Troy,” “One-Eyed Jacks,” “Mutiny on the Bounty” (1962), “Tarzan and His Mate” and “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.”\nThe film runs 1 hour, 59 minutes, and was shot in SoCal and New York.\nGRADE: B-/C+'], ['70%', 'If ever there was a film epitomising the best and worst of the ""American Dream"" then this has to be the one.... Orson Welles has mastered the role of the playboy millionaire who decides to have a go at running a small provincial newspaper - ostensibly to empower the common people and give them a voice... Shortly his combination of wealth, determination and deftness has created a monster with tentacles into almost every aspect of American life; and with that, as they say about absolute power - a good dose of personal ambition and corruption. Gradually losing those around him who debate and challenge, he becomes an intellectual brute; a tyrant - and an emotionally unfulfilled one at that. Joseph Cotton is also superb as his best friend who suffers with his own internal turmoils as he watches the rise and rise of ""Kane""; Everett Sloane as his long-suffering sidekick and Dorothy Comingore as his second wife ""Susan"" plays her role almost exactly as an immature child, in the care of a stern but equally immature guardian. It is as much a social commentary of 1940s aspirational America as it is a powerful depiction of megalomania - and although it has certainly lost some of it\'s bite over the last 80 years it still delivers a powerful analysis of the concentration of wealth, power, and influence that could easily be applied (to social media domination) today. As with so many Hitchcock films, Bernard Hermann delivers an enveloping score in which this all floats nicely - and technically, it wants for nothing - the eeriness and sterility of ""Xanadu"" contributing wonderfully to the last half hour of this enigmatic story.'], ['100%', 'ctually every bit as good as it supposed to be. To anyone who likes to think they\'re being edgy by calling it overrated or whatever, I know you\'re just saying it because you think it makes you cool and counter-cultural or whatever, so I probably can\'t change your mind whatever I say here, but one thing anyone should try is watching all the Academy Award nominees, or at least the Best Picture nominees, from the 14th Academy Awards, in sucession, perhaps one a day. Despite only winning one award, and famously losing out on Best Picture, this film makes all the others look embarrassingly dated. Even the ones that are also very good look like Roundhay Garden Scene compared to this. It truly is a revolution of a film. Welles could have gone exclusively into gore porn after this and he would still be a good candidate for the greatest talent in American cinema. This film has already been rightfully praised so much it\'s hard to find anything new to say about it, so mostly all I can do is heap on more praise to the pile, but this film deserves it.\nA few things are slightly less talked about from this film that I do wanna bring up though;\n1. This is a lot funnier than people give it credit for. Welles himself called it a comedy, I believe, and honestly I can see that. There\'s some very witty dialogue. My favourite gag might be the ""FRAUD AT POLLS"" headline.\n2. Weird how Welles\' obvious self-deprecating joke about how he inserted the screeching cockatoo to wake up any audience members falling asleep has been taken out of context and treated as serious by so many people. It seems obvious to me that it was as a sort of bookend to his relationship with Susan, referring back to the shadow puppet scene where Kane makes a bird\n3. The speech about the girl in the white dress is actually one of my favourite monologues in any film. The ""frame story"" actually has a lot of great moments that people often forget because they spend all their time praising the scenes with Kane in them (and fair enough, they are incredible).\n4. Susan\'s bad singing is some impressive work. It\'s hard to sing purposefully poorly without falling into cartoonist shrieking, but actress Dorothy Comingore is very good at sound just bad enough to be believable.\n6. I like how, unlike most films about ""corrupt rich people"", this doesn\'t moralise or turn its character into a Bond villain, but condemns what he represents far more strongly than if it did, because systemic critiques always hit harder than ""rich people are mean :("", which is one of the most helpful to the status quo statements you can make, implying as it does that it would be fine if the ruling class could throw us a bone with a few more scraps of meat on it.\n7. The opening and final shots might be the best one-two punch of those two things in... certainly a major release American film, if not any film ever. We begin with death, and end with youth. All sounds pretty simple when you say it out loud like this but as I say it\'s already been analysed in so much depth all I can say is either redundant or just feels like explaining why a funny joke is funny.\n8. It\'s hard to review this without sounding silly. ""Masterpiece"" is hilariously understating it. Like, of course Citizen Kane is good.

Films such as Captain America: Winter Solider, Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man all consisted of elements that we have never seen within a superhero film before. Now, Marvel Studios attempts to push the envelop once more by leaving the world of high tech armors and super soldiers and entering the mystical world of magic. Leading this charge is Benedict Cumberbatch\'s Doctor Stephen Strange and hopefully he could answer why there is this strange mystical feeling that we have seen this all before.\nFrom Marvel comes “Doctor Strange,” the story of world-famous neurosurgeon Dr. Stephen Strange whose life changes forever after a horrific car accident robs him of the use of his hands. When traditional medicine fails him, he is forced to look for healing, and hope, in an unlikely place—a mysterious enclave known as Kamar-Taj. He quickly learns that this is not just a center for healing but also the front line of a battle against unseen dark forces bent on destroying our reality. Before long Strange—armed with newly acquired magical powers—is forced to choose whether to return to his life of fortune and status or leave it all behind to defend the world as the most powerful sorcerer in existence.\nI am going to start off the review by discussing the only strong positive thing that came out of Doctor Strange and its by far the visuals. Beautiful vibrant colors pop at you throughout the film, the costume design is beyond extravagant and the framing is spot on. Doctor Strange and his fellow Sorcerers Supremes powers aren\'t fully on display until they enter the Mirror Dimension and my god, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner would hate this place. As they are men of science, they would hate that all rules of physics are thrown out the window as our Sorcerers Supremes are capable of breaking buildings apart and reforming to however they please. It is hard to not reference Inception but no one here is dreaming, these visuals are being created by the hand of mystical men and they use it to their power.\nIn all honestly, pushing the envelope when it comes to visuals was not a difficult task at all. Heck, if they didn\'t I would have been extremely disappointed as it was an obvious opportunity to take advantage of since we are dealing with magic. I am still extremely disappointed regardless as director Scott Derrickson completely missed another obvious opportunity to push the envelope this time in regards of character development.\nDoctor Stephen Strange is very much like a Tony Stark and other superheroes we have seen in films before as he is arrogant, egoistical and full of it. After Strange\'s accident in which he suffered extreme nerve damage to both hands, he dishes out every penny to his name to repair his hands in hopes he could continue his career as neurosurgeon. Every attempt fails and Strange becomes desperate enough to head to Nepal and finds himself under the guidance of Tilda Swinton\'s The Ancient One. Learning a whole new concept in the mystic arts forces Strange to reshape his way of thinking but Scott Derrickson does not let this have Strange reshape who he is as a person as well.\nDoctor Strange should have found himself being more like a Steve Rogers towards the end of the film as learning the mystic arts and his accident alone should have broken his ego. But instead everything still comes easy to him as he masters magic with ease with very little tension. He has a couple hiccups in the beginning but once The Ancient One puts him under her wing it is smooth sailing and Strange is stealing texts, wielding powerful weapons and defeating Supremes with decades of training with ease.\nYou cannot say that Strange was destined for the mystic arts and that is why everything came so easy for him. Strange is only learning the mystic arts due to circumstance. If he doesn\'t get into an accident, which happened to him due to being careless, he doesn\'t find himself in Nepal. Harry Potter was destined for magic, not Strange. Strange fails to grow as a character because he continues to be proven right and no consequences seem to happen due to his actions.\nIt is hard to get into the character development of our supporting characters Benedict Wong\'s Wong and Chiwetel Ejiofor\'s Mordo as I would utterly spoil the film for you. All I would say though is that they were both mishandled and deserved better developments. It is a shame too because Wong and Ejiofor are superb actors but wasting talent is something Marvel Studios is used to.\nWhen will Marvel Studios get a villain right?  With Mads Mikkelsen playing our lead villain, Kaecilius, I thought we might finally get a cinematic Marvel villain that is on par to Killgrave and Kingpin over at Marvel\'s television department. Ultimately, Kaecilius and Doctor Strange end up fighting due to the most silliest cliche: being at the wrong place at the wrong time. The two individuals meet at the New York Sanctum Sanctorum in which Strange accidentally gets blown in to. Kaecilius is there to kill the protector and Sanctum Sanctorum itself and has no knowledge of who Strange is. In fact, he honestly believes Strange\'s name is in fact ""Mister Doctor."" Still learning his craft, Strange is capable of putting up a better fight than the protector who should be a matter. I mean, he is a protector after all. There are no stakes for Strange, strange.\nVisually appealing could only get you so far as Doctor Strange fails to focus on the development of their characters that they made so appealing to the eye. Doctor Strange will become a huge asset to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and lets hope we see the rest of Strange\'s development when he casts his next spell. There is so much untapped potential in Strange\'s character, we just haven\'t seen the best of him yet.'], ['-', 'All continues to be well in the Marvel Comics Universe as the film adaptation of another mischievous and majestic superhero from Stan Lee’s printed page empire emerges and reigns supreme on the big screen. The latest cure from the Marvel movie bag of explosive tricks is the entry of the dazzling and decorative Doctor Strange. Armed with a collection of notable performers, a convincing colorful scope of visual vibrancy and a hearty touch of spiritual and reflective potency the spellbinding Doctor Strange is an engaging and oddly sophisticated action-oriented comic book fantasy adding imaginative flavor to the typical escapist gem from the Marvel stable of powered personalities.\nSome may argue that Doctor Strange is merely another conveyor belt cinematic comics confection that follows a safe and similar makeup that constitutes the obligatory Marvel Comics movie foundation–excitable weirdness, overly splashes of wayward whimsy, copious characterizations attached to their brand of eccentric grandeur and larger-than-life gestures of dark and devious exploits grounded in the basic landscape of good versus evil. Listen, sometimes traveling down the conventional path of constructed and adventurous Marvel-made spectacles is not necessarily a bad thing to consider. After all, the well-known and more popular superhero icons such as Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, The Avengers, and The X-Men for instance seem to benefit nicely from the anticipated formula that routinely delivers the entertaining goods for its avid core of fanboys. So why not wipe off the seemingly obscure and underrated Doctor Strange and provide the same kind of popcorn-pulsating mystique for blockbuster cinema?\nDoctor Strange started out as a comic book creation in 1963 by Steve Ditko and Stan Lee. Director Scott Derrickson (“Paradise Lost”, “The Exorcism of Emily Rose”, “Sinister”, “Deliver Us From Evil”) does an admirable job in giving shades of bizarre brilliance and magical manipulation to an unconventional Marvel comic book character hardly known for his capacity to translate his mystical mastery to celluloid with compelling curiosity. Derrickson, known primarily for his creative juices in the realm of horror fantasies, confidently serves up the off-kilter and hypnotic appeal of Dr. Stephen Strange as embodied by accomplished English actor Benedict Cumberbatch (“Black Mass”, “The Imitation Game”, “12 Years a Slave”). Interestingly, Derrickson and his handful of screenwriters craft Doctor Strange with a mind-blowing measurement of restraint and inquisitiveness. Indeed, Doctor Strange echoes its contemporary Marvel-established movies with predictable pluckiness to a certain extent but what is appreciated more is the uniqueness of the film’s ability to emphasize a cerebral superhero that is cut out of a different kind of creative cloth which feels quite distinctive from other brooding Marvel mavericks. Cumberbatch–mastering a rather effective American-accented sorcerer with skill–has injected a degree of inventive nobility and refinement that uplifts this calculating comic-book fantasy.\nCumberbatch’s egotistical Stephen Strange is an incredibly gifted neurosurgeon. His hands are truly miraculous tools of his medical trade and he takes pride in his abilities to treat the critical patients that have tremendous hope courtesy of his therapeutic capabilities. In a nutshell, Strange outshines his other surgical competitors because he is able to give to his patients on the operating table something other doctors cannot instantly muster up. However, cruel fate strikes its ugly head when Strange suffers the usage of his precious hands as a result of a horrific car wreck. The nerves in his hands are destroyed and the non-functioning of his limbs is an awful reminder that his surgical talents are something of the immediate past.\nAs Strange delves into self-pity and surfacing depression he cannot see just how supportive his fellow physician Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdam) is toward him. Clearly, Christine is in love with the alienating medical moper but Strange simply does not realize the extent of her affections because he is too busy sulking about his misfortune. The only factor that gets a promising rise out of Strange is his recent acknowledgement of the Tibetan community where there is a Kamar-Taj temple rumored to restore ailing body parts destined to make an individual “whole” and “complete” once again. Naturally, Strange wants to bypass the tedious and lengthy therapy sessions for a chance to experience the miracle of his once-amazing operating digits now ravaged by severe nerve damage.\nThe main source behind the Kamar-Taj temple’s heralded existence is The Ancient One (played by Tilda Swinton). She is instrumental in teaching the fundamentals of a selected Eastern mysticism that teaches the special concentration of healing the wounded and wasting human body when scientific medical practices fail to do so. Soon, Strange’s affiliation with The Ancient One and her mystical minions has more than a transfixing effect on gaining control of his ailing hands as he gains indescribable powers through the inner strength of mind and soul. Now, Dr. Strange can generate his own alternating state of philosophical wizardry that dictates shaping time and space dimensions. Strange’s out-of-body experiences supersede all his previous physical impairments as a force to be reckoned with at large. Whether observing Strange’s Cloak of Levitation methods or witnessing his supernatural prowess on the mean streets against wickedness Doctor Strange spins a wild and weird web of action-packed surrealism that is a welcomed addition to Marvel Comics’ showcasing of super-heroic protective cads feisty in flaws and frivolity.\nCumberbatch is mesmerizing as the self-absorbed genius Strange who perhaps is the best complex Marvel-related protagonist since Robert Downey Jr.’s flippant Tony Stark/Iron Man. The combination of heightened arrogance and high-brow self-doubt and vulnerability tactically works as Cumberbatch sells this portrayal solidly. Although Swinton’s The Ancient One is an intriguing enigma in her own right one must question why the absence of an Asian actor not considered for this particular role may have some scratching their heads in indignation? McAdam’s love interest Christine amounts to only being an afterthought not just in the eyes of her object of affection Strange but to the audience as well.\nThankfully, the other supporting players contribute marvelously to the festivities. Oscar nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor (Cumberbatch’s co-star from the Academy Award-winning “12 Years a Slave”) plays fellow sorcerer Mordo while Benedict Wong assumes the duty as another one of The Ancient One’s followers who guards the school’s sacred scriptures. Mads Mikkelsen is devilishly received as Kaecilius, the former disciple of The Ancient One gone rogue whose agenda in releasing an ominous demon Dormammu to the world will test the will of Doc Strange’s newfound mystical techniques and tactics.\nNo doubt that Doctor Strange is an impeccably surging superhero fable laced with stunning aesthetics and a richly robust score by Michael Giachinno. The high caliber of talent associated with this spry comic book actioner definitely ensures another superhero film franchise-in-the-making as Cumberbatch’s introspective doc administers his Strange dosage of Marvel movie-making medicine for the ages.\nDoctor Strange (2016)\nWalt Disney Pictures\n2 hrs. 10 mins.\nStarring: Benedict Cumberbatch, Tilda Swinton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mads Mikkelsen, Rachel McAdam, Benedict Wong, Benjamin Bratt\nDirected by: Scott Derrickson\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\nGenre: Science Fiction & Fantasy/Action & Adventures/Comic Book Fable\nCritic’s rating: *** 1/2 (out of 4 stars)\n(c) Frank Ochieng 2016'], ['70%', ""Though the core events may not be anything new for the MCU, particularly in so far as its origin stories go (Stephen Strange's A-to-B is virtually identical to Tony Stark's in the first Iron Man film) the psychedelic filter through which we experience these events is entirely fresh!\nNot all of the humour lands, and in fact sometimes actually detracts from the story.

This was based on the Marvel comics that I haven't touched. So basically I had high expectation to witness another side of Marvel universe with another set of (super)heroes. And surprisingly, it was very entertaining, nothing like other Marvel's heroes/story, except the possession of superpower to fight evil forces.\nFirstly, Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead in a Marvel film, I did not think it would work. All I knew is he was a great sidekick, but that image has changed here. He was wonderful, definitely I'll be looking forward to its sequel as they had confirmed at the end. The theme wise, it is similar to most of the superhero tales, but some new concepts were added to it, I mean the superpower and that's what made it so unique.\nJust like 'Thor', this film as well had taken the spiritual believes only for the basic platform. The rest of the developments are the clear mix of fantasy (illusion) and science. So it means the film is for theists and atheists. I am one of those who did not like 'Inception', which I think an ordinary action film with multiple layers. But this one was so awesome and it is for the people like me who think 'Inception' failed.\nVisually spectacular. I regret missing it out in digital 3D. Its Academy Awards nominee in the category of Best VFX tells the story. There will be a tough contest, even I'm up for 'Jungle Book', but I won't be sad if this wins. The success story of Marvel continues. Not everybody reads comic books, but film goers are the majority. So adaptations like this are people like me. Let them keep coming, I love this format better.

So I am about to remedy that now. To put it in simple terms: This is an excellent movie. It is a wonderful display of magical fireworks with a decent enough story to keep it together.\nI have to confess that I have not really read many of the comics containing Doctor Strange so it is a bit difficult for me to comment on the aspect of the film versus the comics. From the little that I have read I got the impression that the comic book version of Doctor Strange was a wee bit more dark, serious and mature. This movie starts from the beginning of his career though so I guess there is some justification for the less mature Doctor Strange in the movie.\nDoctor Strange is a skilled neurosurgeon but a bit of an asshole. Actually more than “a bit”. He gets involved in a accident, that he pretty much causes himself due to his arrogance. Fast forward to the interesting chapter were we get to see Doctor Strange being, reluctantly, admitted into a scruffy looking monastery on the other side of the planet. That is when the fun starts. Doctor Strange is in for a ride. Slowly Doctor Strange gets knocked into him that magic exists and he is expected to practice it.\nThe time at the monastery, or perhaps we should call it a school, leads to a few funny episodes and I do like the head monk’s bantering with Strange and the way she does things. Talk about getting thrown into the deep end of the swimmingpool first. Strange’s continued arrogance and immaturity is a bit annoying from time to time though. That has to be said.\nWhat is the use of super heroes if there are no bad guys around. So after Strange having trained for a while, and mostly failed miserably, the bad guys starts to crash the party. So no more pretty living room magic for Strange. It is time to go head to head with some serious competition. Unfortunately, for a good chunk of the first fights Strange mostly falls on his arse. They are still cool and beautiful to watch though.\nSlowly Strange starts to get to grip with this whole magic thing and he also starts to shed some of that arrogance of his and take some responsibility. About time since the despicable bad guy are, of course, working towards freeing the real BIG bad guy, father of all evil and mother of everything else bad you can think of. Time for a showdown.\nAs the fighting escalates so does the user of special effects and personally I though the special effects were both beautiful and spectacular. I really liked them.\nI am not sure Cumberbatch would have been my first choice for Doctor Strange though. To me he do not really project the image of the wise and skilled Wizard I expected. He is not bad though. The only other person that stood out for me was the chief monk and The Ancient One which I also quite liked. The rest of the characters, well to me they mostly lived in the shadows of these two, even though they were in general likable and sometimes fun.\nThere were a few rather hilarious parts where Strange has to reveal the truth about what he stepped in to his former girlfriend. I have a soft spot for the surprise moments in both movies and books.\nI rather not get started on time travel since I generally hate it as a story element since it almost always leads to paradoxes or is simply so poorly done that it is blatantly obvious that someone tried to cover up for a lazy and shoddy story. However I guess I have to mention that screwing around with time is an important part of the plot in this movie. Luckily it is done in such a way that it do not, in my opinion, negatively impact the movie. Actually, to my surprise, it is used in a rather cool way.\nSo, bottom line, a movie I liked quite a lot. 5 out 5 stars kind worth of liking.'], ['90%', 'I thought marvel was going to far with all the releases.I was right about this one,Dr Strange was like Inception on DMT.Far to much CGI!.And for the story it started off in the right direction then it just ended up going STRANGE.All in all worth a look.But nothing special.'], ['70%', 'It was only a matter of time before magic and time travel found their way into the MCU, but Doctor Strange is a really well put together origin story on a character that could have been a mess to adapt as a film.

Either way.\nA quick note for surviving other then the soundproofing here and there. Why not have a sound bomb of sorts, you could just throw? That would have toldy saved the Dad from having to sacrifice him self.\nThat isn’t to say they’re stupid they had many Smart decisions such a The sand paths, the box for the baby (wish was kinda sad), the little sound proof room, the Radio, and the fireworks.

The movie setup is incredibly well-built to transpire the precaution, the constant fear, and the direful consequences of an unthought action in this terrible future. The sound effects are awesome, and the director can successfully use the nearly-constant silence in contrast to the hassle of being followed by those creatures.\nThe acting is solid and helps to immerse the watcher in the well-built plot.\nMy only regret for this movie is that it ends during a climax, when we are not ready to stop watching it yet. It could be 30 minutes longer to explain some missing points and to show what happens after the ending.\nOverall, an awesome movie, well-thought and beautifully produced in every aspect.'], ['60%', ""Every time a horror movie does something that I've never seen before, that gets me very excited.

They’re basically a knock-off of the monster in “Cloverfield” (2008), albeit the smaller size of the creatures in those previous flicks.\nWhile this movie gets a lot of praise in some circles, the constant mistakes of the family members gets frustrating and tiresome.

Therefore, I vividly remember discovering that John Krasinski was directing, writing, and starring in a low-budget, original horror flick and feeling incredibly interested, to the point of considering it one of my most anticipated movies of the respective year. I absolutely adore the actor\'s memorable performance in The Office, but I never really saw anything worth noting from him after that show. Adding Emily Blunt (Sicario, Edge of Tomorrow) - her ""slightly more famous"" wife - was definitely an attention-grabbing move, especially when the young actors were still unknown at the time of release.\nWith the help of Bryan Woods and Scott Beck, Krasinski developed a screenplay based on a relatively simple yet highly impactful, imaginative premise. Creepy, scary monsters who hunt by sound isn\'t exactly a mind-blowing story aspect, but the extreme amount of tension and suspense transform a regular theater session into a nail-biting, nerve-wracking cinematic experience. Fortunately, the audience at my first screening was really invested in the film, which made for a truly unforgettable moment that I know some people didn\'t have due to disrespectful moviegoers. However, if there\'s one thing no one can take away from A Quiet Place is that it works just as well or better watching at home with the lights out in the silence of our own house.\nSome viewers might look at this movie solely as an entertaining horror film with effective jumpscares, shock value, and cool monsters, which are all great attributes. However, the reason why everything works so well is indisputably due to the profoundly well-explored family. Thematically, parenthood and family love are subjects that Krasinski and his team of writers deeply expand upon, primarily through the father-daughter relationship. Being a parent is seen by many as a daunting task, filled with the inevitable fear of not being considered a good father or mother. Lee and Regan\'s (Millicent Simmonds) difficulties in understanding each other are not only remarkably relatable, but their bond also contributes to some of the most emotional scenes of the movie.\nLee and Evelyn only desire to keep their children safe, but when the world is packed with merciless creatures that kill if a pin drops, some details like having a deaf daughter certainly don\'t help their mission. They do, however, dial up the levels of tension and suspense to their maximum. Krasinski shows tremendous skill as the director by delivering excruciatingly suspenseful build-ups and exceptionally effective scares. His ability to drastically change the entire mood of a scene offers the viewers several genuinely captivating sequences. Horror-wise, there\'s plenty to enjoy. From creative atmospheric sequences to jaw-dropping, shocking plot points, A Quiet Place has something for everyone.\nI\'ve addressed Krasinski\'s work as both director and writer, but he also offers what I believe to be his career-best performance in a feature film. Both he and Emily Blunt perfectly capture the terrifying feeling of living in a post-apocalyptic environment. The protection of their children carries overwhelming despair of losing them to the visually distinct monsters, and both actors shine in their roles. However, my personal standout is Simmonds (Wonderstruck) and Noah Jupe (Honey Boy, Ford v Ferrari). Both were unknown young actors at the original release date, but they steal the spotlight from the big stars. Jupe proves that he has everything to become an Oscar-winner - the demand for him is exponentially rising - and Simmonds delivers one of the best performances I\'ve ever seen from a real-life deaf actress, bringing a great deal of authenticity to her display.\nAll incorporate their characters seamlessly. The interactions between the adult and young actors feel as realistic and honest as possible, also due to the beautifully written screenplay. Technically, I must praise the phenomenal work done with such a low budget. All the way from the shooting location to the sound department, it truly feels like every single person had an essential role in the making of this movie. Not even the monsters are at fault, and there are a couple of close-ups that could have easily been awful, but the VFX artists really step up to the plate and deliver wonderfully horrific creatures. It\'s well-edited (Christopher Tellefsen), well-shot (Charlotte Bruus Christensen), and the score (Marco Beltrami) is employed just at the right moments.\nI only have one major issue with the film. Story-wise, even though the audience is placed in a fictional world, it feels so real that it\'s hard to ignore a couple of logical questions regarding the fate of the rest of humanity. These nitpicks don\'t really bother me, but the ending of the movie still doesn\'t sit well with me after many viewings. Without spoiling it, of course, the very last shot feels like a cry to Hollywood to make a sequel, which I have to admit is somewhat disappointing. Finally, a film that doesn\'t belong to cinematic universes or titanic franchises focuses on telling an engaging story with characters worth investing our time on… all to end in a slightly out-of-character moment so more movies can be made?\nA Quiet Place remains emotionally impactful, as well as incredibly suspenseful and tense, even after multiple viewings. Boasting a concept so unique yet so simple, John Krasinski and his fellow co-writers create a profoundly well-explored, character-driven horror story packed with relatable family issues and impressive performances across the board. Through justified shock value and surprisingly investing non-verbal dialogues, this film is one more piece of evidence that the best horror emerges from remarkable character building. The popular actor also proves to be a phenomenal director, generating extreme suspense quickly, drastically altering the entire atmosphere of a scene seamlessly. Technically, it genuinely feels like a low-budget flick where every single department has a noticeable impact on the final product, but the menacing, distinct-looking CGI monsters do steal the spotlight. Despite a few logical issues and an ending that feels more corporate than indie, my love for this movie continues intact. Hopefully, its sequel won\'t be a disappointment.\nRating: A-'], ['40%', ""Works for a normal audience, not for critical thinkers\nAlmost an 8/10 on a different, shabbier, online movie database with almost 14 hundred reviews at the point of this review written.

Stuff like that, it\'s annoying that it took me out of it every now and then, I can\'t lie.\nAs noted though, it is still a fun watch and I\'m certainly wanting to check out the sequel. I just don\'t think I\'ve ever had a film that I enjoy but has such noticeable stupidness, the latter usually outweighs the former - or vice versa. So kudos for that, I guess, Krasinski & Co.']]"

Indeed, despite a promising (if frustrating) shower scene at the top of the film, Blyth (""Coryo"") is really what drags this otherwise quite decent action adventure film down. Rachel Zegler, on the other hand, is full of enthusiasm as her ""Lucy Gray"" character is selected to fight for District 12 in the ""Hunger Games"". Meantime, ""Dean Highbottom"" (the infrequently used Peter Dinklage) has come up with a way to spike the dwindling television ratings. He has decided to allocate one of his top students to mentor each of the captives. Yep - ""Coryo"" is put with ""Lucy Gray"". A bit of sabotage changes the nature of the game and gradually our hero starts to wonder if he is on the right side - especially when he becomes a little too emotionally involved with his protégé and attracts the enmity of his own erstwhile mentor. Luckily, the whole scenario is being overseen by the hammily menacing ""Volumnia Gaul"" (Viola Davis) who is clearly having a ball with industrial scale make up and a barrel of genetically modified snakes. The last twenty minutes smacks a little too much of sequel building, but this film has plenty of action and intrigue, loads of back-stabbing and just a little moralising. Zegler delivers a few folky style ballads confidently and generally does a lively enough job keeping it quite a bit better than I was expecting.

The adaptation of the novel to the movie was done so well that it is really remarkable. A very high quality cinematography is present.  Rachel Zegler is the personification of Lucy Gray, while Tom Blyth is a leading man.\nWhat an amazing experience it was! The whole auditorium was sitting on the edge of their seats, completely silent, and just appreciating the movie. Everything in the film was flawless, including the narrative, the acting, the music, and the allusions.\nIn the first place, I feel it is necessary to offer my daughter, Rachel Zegler, some praise. Her performance as Lucy Gray gave the impression that she had actually torn her off the page. Rachel did a wonderful job of portraying Lucy Gray, who was the epitome of perfection, and I don't believe anybody else could have achieved the same level of success. Rachel's singing is even more incredible than her acting, by a significant margin. It is common knowledge that Rachel is an incredible vocalist, but the way she sings in this film leaves me feeling as if I had never heard her voice before. She is such a powerhouse of an actor, and I am so thrilled to watch her succeed in this production. The fact that she sang everything live on set is another reason why I am so proud of her. In my view, this is without a doubt her finest performance so far.\nFollowing that, I feel compelled to call attention to the outstanding performance that Tom Blyth gave as Snow. He did a fantastic job of taking what Donald Sutherland had done with the role and giving it his own spin while still making it his own interpretation of the character. On Snow, Tom was able to bring out both the charming and the insane aspects of her personality. I found his acting to be particularly noteworthy in the third act of the movie, particularly the moment in which he was seen in the woods with Lucy Gray. The manner in which Tom was able to incorporate everything of Snow's inner monologue that is shown to us in the novel into his facial expressions was absolutely stunning. He did an excellent job in this function.\nWhen it comes to this film, there are a lot of other things that I could simply enthuse about. Every single one of the other performers had outstanding performances, and they were all outstanding. On top of that, the music is really fantastic. It is impossible for me to adequately express why I feel the desire to have the music of this movie infused into my veins. The soundtrack was so powerful that it brought tears to my eyes even at the very beginning of the film, when there was nothing that was really occurring at that point!!!! In addition, I would like to draw attention to the outstanding costume design that was done for this film.\nThis movie brought us back into the realm of Panem, and it seemed as if we had never left! There were so many things and individuals that worked together to make this happen. The movie was really stunning, thanks to the stunning performances, locations, costumes, and music that Olivia Rodrigo contributed, among other things.\nSince the first nostalgic film in the series, which was released in 2012 and starred Jennifer Lawrence as the legendary songbird mockingjay herself, Katniss Everdeen, this has quickly become my favorite installment in the series. All things considered, this is a smashing success for moviegoers and movie aficionados alike; you should not miss it when it is shown on the big screen.""], ['50%', 'This movie was sooooo long and had way too much singing, a bunch of which was very cringey. The romance between Snow and Lucy wasn\'t believable at all and I guess Snow was just a total psychopath all along anyway, so maybe that part was intentional.

I don\'t recommend putting this ham on your face.'], ['60%', ""I was thoroughly enjoying this... until it absolutely nosedives during the latter half.\n'The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes' starts off so strongly, continuing at a pleasant pace as it encompasses the Hunger Games itself. However, from the end of the event it truly does drop off a cliff out of nowhere. The film gives you a major high of action with the games, then drops the tempo down to such a slow first act-esque pace that it feels extremely tacked on.\nI did enjoy the cast throughout, mostly. Tom Blyth is excellent, first time I've seen him properly in a film and I was very impressed; though even his performance suffers with the aforementioned, which for him is from the point that he becomes The Real Slim Shady, seemingly (his originally look is so much better). Still, I'm eager to see that guy act further.\nRachel Zegler is largely good, though does chew the scenery quite a bit in parts; predominantly when singing. Viola Davis is great, while Peter Dinklage is underused but still a positive. Jason Schwartzman and Josh Andrés Rivera, meanwhile, are solid enough supports.\nJust a shame about the final act. It's not necessarily that bad in itself, but to lower the pace that sharply after such prolonged thrill is a recipe for disaster. So much so that it makes the whole part drag hard, or perhaps 'twas just so for me?""]]"

Or maybe not.\nListen to the Awesome Friday Podcast for more:'], ['70%', 'The subject of artificial intelligence has been all over the news in recent months, with much of the coverage (save for what’s in the business/finance pages) presented in an often-troubling, cautionary light. So, from this, it’s easy to see how it  didn’t take long for this topic to make its way into the world of entertainment, as evidenced in writer-director Gareth Edwards’s latest feature offering. This tale about a brutal war between Asia and America over the future of this controversial technology leads to a series of epic revelations, including some that shift the prevailing view of the evils of AI (most notably exposing where the real source of concern about this technology lies). It also serves as a poignant metaphor for the nature of East-West geopolitical relations, the underlying tensions of the conflict represented by the superficial reasons cited as the cause of combat. And all of the foregoing considerations grow progressively stronger and more impressive as the story plays out. However, in the film’s prologue and opening act, the narrative comes across like an uninspired amalgamation of sci-fi tropes culled from an array of other movies and TV series, including “Blade Runner” (1982), “Edge of Tomorrow” (2014), “Oblivion” (2013), “I, Robot” (2004), “The Terminator” franchise and the rebooted version of Battlestar Gallactica (2004-2009), among others. Also, the story, much of which consists of an involved high-stakes pursuit, is overly stretched out at times, a quality that could have been improved upon with some judicious editing. To its credit, though, the picture features excellent special effects, a fair amount of smartly written comic relief and a surprisingly good cast for a sci-fi release (particularly protagonist John David Washington and youthful newcomer Madeleine Yuna Voyles, despite a seriously miscast Allison Janney in a supporting role as an overwrought member of the military brass). “The Creator” is indeed more insightful and thought-provoking than what many of its detractors have said, though it’s understandable how its periodic lapses in originality and inventiveness may be seen as undermining these strengths. Nevertheless, these shortcomings should be taken with a grain of salt, and the film should be given a fair shot for what it has to say about something that’s becoming an increasingly more significant aspect of our lives, something that we had better to learn to understand and live with if we hope to make friends with it as part of our existence going forward.'], ['60%', 'Right, well I was really disappointed with this. It\'s like a precursor to the ""Terminator"" films with ""Joshua"" (John David Washington) charged with tracking down and destroying a super-weapon being devised by the AI that mankind developed to keep it safe, but that turned the tables on us all and now robots are ruling the Earth. Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as ""Col. Howell"" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is ""Alphie"" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it\'s ears. It\'s just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt. To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes. Bet it cost a fortune, but it\'s all just a bit forgettably lacking.'], ['100%', 'Perhaps the greatest thing this remarkable film brings to the table is value of love and life, over war and death.\nI am surprised this film was made, in so much, as it shows exactly what the US military industrial complex, stands for. That is callous cruelty, violence, intolerance and death.\nIn a sense then this film could be said to be set in any of the battlefields, in any Asian country, the US has invaded. The fact it has a futuristic overlay, does not detract from powerful and often moving, anti-war, pro peace message, it compellingly conveys. It could not be more timely either, given the US\'s attempts, to light wars across the world.\nI rarely call a film ""inspired"" in its honesty and its humanity, but The Creator meets that definition, in every sense.

The movie moves around John David Washington as Sergeant Joshua Taylor, that haves a prosthetic robotic arm and leg lost in the nuclear explosion.\nBack then he involved himself with an asiatic woman called Maya (Gemma Chan), that the learns to be the one called Nirmata (Creator) the founder of the AI of New Asia, through the daughter that they had together, a robotic simulant called Alphie that possesses powers toward machines.\nThe positive: the visual both at scenes, characters or settings are just EXPLENDID, well done CG - just imagine Rogue One, but into this Asiatic setting that mixtures basic living and hi tech.

But I consider that it is something to be watched because of the digital effects and production, as a basic that no movie must cost more than $ 100 million to have stellar visuals.\nFor me the score is 6,0 out of 10,0 / B - C+.  The stars are for visual effects only.'], ['-', '""The Creator"" is a new film directed by Gareth Edwards, whose credits include 2014\'s ""Godzilla"" and ""Star Wars Story 1"". Will his new work go down in the annals of sci-fi cinema in gold?\n ""The Creator"" begins with a newsreel informing us that in 2055, a nuclear warhead was detonated in Los Angeles by an artificial intelligence. This prompted the US to ban the use and development of AI. However, not every country approaches AI in the same way. In Asia, AI is not banned. Fifteen years later, the military is on the hunt for Nirmata, the mysterious creator of artificial intelligence, who has now developed a new weapon that could turn the situation against America. Sergeant Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) is sent to the Republic of New Asia in search of Nirmata and the weapon, but is more eager to find his lost love Maya (Gemma Chan). Accompanied by soldiers, he finds neither Maya nor weapons - only a \'simulant\' (the most advanced form of AI) in the form of a child with unique powers. Despite his hatred of AI - his family were killed in the LA explosion - Joshua has no choice but to pair up with this young girl, whom he calls Alphie, in the hope that she will lead him to his beloved Maya.\nWatching The Creator, if you have experienced sci-fi cinema before, you will quite often have a sense of déjà vu, as the filmmakers have stitched together elements from numerous previous works of the genre. You will therefore find the spectre of plot ideas from such productions as Blade Runner, Akira, The Terminator, District 9 and even Apocalypse Now, Leon the Professional and Terrence Malick\'s The Thin Red Line. And these are just a few examples. At the same time, the authors of ""The Creator"" have managed to put these elements together in such a skilful way that the whole is an independent, original achievement, although every now and then it is reminiscent of its great predecessors.\nWhat we have here is a war with AI, road cinema, the story of a chosen one who is to save the world, or at least change the fate of the conflict. In the background, tragic love. Along the way, there is no armchair-pressing twist waiting for us, so \'The Maker\' is, for all intents and purposes, a basically predictable work. But also fresh enough to hold the viewer\'s interest. At least in theory. The visuals are excellent (although too many of the spectacle scenes were shot in the dark - a constant problem for Hollywood, which thus solves the problem of costly fine-tuning of CGI effects). Edwards and the team have created a world of the near future that looks realistic. The action is largely set in Asia, which also adds to the exoticism of the whole thing and takes us away from the standard sci-fi cinema images. There\'s a kind of visual poetry and sensibility in \'The Creator\' that you don\'t often find in this genre of cinema (and watching it on big IMAX screens, if you have the opportunity, only enhances this). The problem begins, however, when we get to the script. Because skilfully piecing together a script from classic sci-fi tropes (and more) is one thing, but creating an engaging and full-blooded story out of it all is another. I, unfortunately, did not find great layers of emotion in The Creator, although the filmmakers were clearly trying to emotionally engage the viewer.\nI am sorry to say that I did not care about the fate of the main character. The problem lies partly in the script, but also partly in John David Washington himself, who plays him. Denzel\'s son may not be a bad actor, but he doesn\'t have even half the charisma of his father, on top of which his roles so far have been waspish every time, even when his characters weren\'t meant to be that way at all. I don\'t believe him when I see him concerned, scared, angry, loving. For me, he\'s an actor fit to play cold mercenaries in war films. There is a kind of indifference, an absence in his gaze. On top of this, the heart and soul of \'The Creator\', as I understand it, was supposed to be in the forming relationship between Joshua and Alpha, but unfortunately I found it hard to believe in the emerging bond between them, as it was presented unconvincingly, rather rushed and a bit more along the lines that the viewer is just supposed to believe at some point that the two have taken a liking to each other, although we don\'t really see on screen when this happened or why. Also, the finale, while most impressive, feels chaotic, rushed and not entirely satisfying. Other than that it was easily predictable.'], ['100%', 'The ensemble cast delivers commendable performances, with standout moments from supporting actors like ken watanabe, who portrays a father of AI developer, and Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who brings a magnetic presence to the role of Alphie.

This is why I find stories about real human emotions to be so much more exciting than the latest, generic action retread. The plot is advanced by the things the characters say and how their emotions guide their futures.\nThe film offers ambiguous motivations. On the surface we see them caring for each other, but what lies deep beneath is a much more selfish reality that put them in a survival mode. Each of them is a well written being.

This does not last as a dangerous adversary known as the Taskmaster arrives and sets a chain of events into motion.\nNatasha has been sent a package from her cover sister Yelena (Florence Pugh) who also went through the Red Room and became a top assassin in the years since she and Natasha last saw one another.\nDespite her mixed feelings; Natasha ventures to Budapest and confronts Yelena who in turn reveals the package she sent her contains a compound that can free the other Black Widows from the control of the Red Room which despite Natasha’s insistence is still very much alive as is the head of the institute which she is convinced she killed long ago.\nWith Taskmaster and other Widows hot on their trail, Natasha and Yelena are forced to seek the help of their former “Father” the imprisoned hero Red Guardian (David Harbour), and their cover Mother Melina (Rachel Weisz), to find the location of the new Red Room; free the Widows, and end the program once and for all.\nWhat follows is an engaging story with solid action and effects that remains at its core a character story as Natasha attempts to reconcile her cover family with her new Avengers family and the pain of her upbringing and conditioning.\nMarvel resisted calls from some to release the film on Disney+ last year when the Pandemic caused multiple delays to the planned release dates.

Speaking of the big twist, Matthew Lillard played William Afton perfectly; I can\'t imagine someone else playing the role. He tuned into who William Afton was so well. The line ""I always come back"" didn\'t really fit; at that moment, how does he know he will come back? The lack of scares in the film and the fact that Mr. Cupcake gets the most kills in the whole film are insane to me. FNaF is a jumpscare game, and this film focused more on the human story, which is fine; I would\'ve liked more than a few jumpscares. I also don\'t care for the animatronics being all friendly; their kids are trapped in robots. Unless those kids were born killing, I can\'t see how people can be mad at the animatronics for being friendly.']]"

I rate any movie based on a few things. Warning! Potential Spoilers.\n1. Story. Is the story compelling, does it stick in your mind after the movie, haunting you like a ghost, forcing you to think about it and even your own life? Does it have any positive messages aka moral of the story.\nThe story of The Way of Water is indeed compelling. The Conflict is multifaceted. Family conflict, Human-Na'vi conflict, Tribal Conflict and most importantly, personal conflict, aka identity conflict. The identity conflict is mostly fuelled by outcast feeling. There are a lot of people including Jake who at some point feel like they don't belong. I believe most people feel this way at some point in life, you don’t need to be in the protected minority groups for you to feel like an outcast. And while we may not be accepted for who we are, defining who are begins with ourselves first. Our world is full of people who want to be identified in one way or another. But have they identified themselves first? Just remember, most people feel discriminated for one reason or another in life. Religion, gender, skin colour, country, body size or smartness in school, political affiliation. Nobody gets love all round all times. Know who you are and don’t fuss to much about it. Learn a losson from Spider (Miles Socorro).\n2. Characters. Are there likeable characters you can get attached to? Characters you remember later, characters that inspire. Characters that grow.\nSpidey is a new character, and he has a great story to tell. Jake has changed a lot too and for good reason. People undergo a lot of transformation in life. You can’t be what Don Williams calls a Rake and Ramblin’ Man your entire life. I read an article review complaining how Jake tucked his tail and ran. That review completely missed the point. Jakes decision may not have been the right one, but put in his situation, it is a decision that a lot of people would make.\n3. Acting. Is the acting good? Is it realistic enough to be believable to a point you forget the people are just acting? I was more than impressed by Neytiri’s “gone nuts” scene. I felt her pain, and in that instance, I was nuts too. I honestly forgot this was just a movie. Actors can make you cry, and that is just how it should be. You forget that it is just an act, no need to cry. I also read an article that complained about the dialogue of the teenagers. I don’t know what the reviewer expected. Philosophy from teens? Their conversation is believable enough for their age.\n4. Everything tied together. A good story told by good and believable characters needs a setup. Something to tie them together into a bundle.  Avatar ties everything together with wonderful visuals. I don’t need to say more.""], ['40%', 'State-of-the-art special effects, revolutionary underwater cameras, and the resurrection of what is otherwise a mostly forgotten movie theater format can’t hide the fact that Avatar: The Way of Water is basically the same movie as the original with more blue people (some are slightly green now!) that get on your last nerve.

Directed by Brian de Palma, it marked its time, but is currently somewhat forgotten. It's understandable: in addition to the gratuitous violence and the crudeness with which it approaches the topic of drug trafficking, we don't have any character here that we are capable of liking, and this puts a wall between the film and the viewer.\nBrian de Palma is a very solid director.

The sets and costumes not only fit well into the decade, but also manage to emphasize the characters' sense of nouveau riche and fast ascent. Of course, it's absurdly kitsch, even the soundtrack tells us that! However, we can't expect anything else from characters with no taste, no culture, no education and tons of money to show off! However, I will agree if someone tell me that the film is too long, with some scenes a bit incidental or unbelievable (that scene where Gina, enraged, gives herself sexually to her brother, was a good example). With little effort, about half an hour could have been removed from this film, making it more palatable.\nThe film's script is based on a remake of an original from 1932, which very few people know, and which was made by Howard Hughes. Perhaps the name of this film is slightly inspired by the figure of Al Capone, who had the unflattering nickname of “scarface”. In one of the most notable performances of his career, Al Pacino is histrionic, unpleasant and paranoid to the extreme. The intentional exaggeration may be off-putting, but it seems to be in line with a film where everything is exaggerated.

I was thinking comedy version of Kill Bill (for the gore and killing) with supers in it when I was watching it.\nI have to say that I enjoyed watching it though.\nThe movie makes absolutely no pretense of being taken seriously. The “heros” are outrageously wacky and so are most normal persons in the movie.

I hate this “24 hours earlier…” bullshit or any permutations thereof.\nI also really didn’t like the “It’s the evil US government conducting illegal evil experiments and we’re supposed to cover it up” story line. It just typical Hollywood overused crap.\nI did like the action though. As I wrote before it is ridiculously gory and very very comical. So is a lot of the dialog which of course is as crazy and weird as the rest of the movie. In any other movie as large shark with legs walking on land saying “yum yum” and then eating someone, repeatedly, would be just cringeworthy. In this movie it actually works.\nThe movie is 2 hours 12 minutes long and it really did not feel too long. It was 2+ hours of fun entertainment.\nThe post credit scene was a bit lame though.

Impactful imagery and an extremely stirring score make the audiovisual experience even more captivating.\nIt\'s not without issues, but it\'s one of the most important stories to watch/read this century.""\nRating: B'], ['70%', ""The acting is all really quite adequate here, but it's not really that important to the fascinating underlying premiss that underpins the theory that race, in itself, might not be the reasons for the hierarchical nature of a society that always manages to create sub-classes. Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor offers her own engaging perspective on author Isabel Wilkerson who is invited by a publisher to offer a more considered and less reactionary appraisal of race relations following the murder of a young black man who just happened to be in the wrong place (a white neighbourhood) at the wrong time. The audience know full well from the outset what has happened here, so that's not especially important to the plot either - it's her search for a rationale. That search attempts to draw parallels between the plight of the African American citizenry with the victims of Holocaust and of the system of caste that prevails in India. By spending a section of the film in Germany and then in India, we are exposed to a more internationalist view of just why society is made up of the have lots, the haves and the have nots - and at just how little much of that has changed for centuries. The comparison she develops works surprisingly convincingly, if not without it's flaws, and Ellis-Taylor acts well as a sort of sponge for the philosophies that emerge. The one element that it rather studiously avoids is religion. That isolation does rather compromise the authenticity of any conclusion as it doesn't acknowledge that so often the behaviour and structures of cultures are dictated by those atop them in some form of priesthood - whether they be Brahmin or Cardinal. There are a few familial sub-plots to add a bit of drama to the story, but I found them a little unnecessary as the theory elaborates more. It does come from a very specific American perspective - I'd be interested to see how it might turn out if it were to be remade from a Jewish or Indian point of view, but as it is - it's a thoughtful exercise in what makes human strata function and endure.""], ['80%', 'Those who believe that institutionalized systemic racism is fundamentally an American problem should probably give a serious look to this latest offering from writer-director Ava DuVernay, best known for the superb historical drama, “Selma” (2014). Based on the book Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents by best-selling author Isabel Wilkerson, the film examines how organic prejudices are actually a worldwide phenomenon that may or may not have anything specifically to do with race but are more readily attributable to matters of caste. While the picture indeed examines this practice from an American perspective, it also addresses it from the standpoint of the dictates employed in Nazi Germany and in the longstanding Indian caste system, where race was/is not an inherent issue. Rather, the institutionalized discriminatory practices in these locales (as well as in others) were (and in some cases still are) driven by the implementation of artificial distinctions that have been established and perpetuated based on other characteristics but that have had the same kinds of negative impact as those driven by race-based policies. The filmmaker explores how author Wilkerson (Aunjanue Ellis Taylor) went about researching and writing the book on this subject, a project undertaken at a time when she was dealing with the fallout from a series of personal tragedies involving her mother (Emily Yancy), husband (Jon Bernthal) and cousin (Niecy Nash-Betts), giving her a reason to pick herself up and carry on with her life. Admittedly, the multiple story threads involved in the narrative and the way in which they’re organized could have used some tweaking for greater clarity and smoother connectedness, and the author’s theories could have stood to be presented a little less overly intellectually at times. However, in the end, the movie’s themes successfully come together to create a captivating and eye-opening hypothesis that we’d all be wise to consider seriously. What’s more, the depiction of Wilkerson’s personal story is filled with a series of strongly emotive moments that are sure to tug heartily at the heart strings, so keep the hankies handy. The film also features an array of fine, small-role supporting performances from the likes of Nick Offerman, Blair Underwood, Audra McDonald, Finn Whitrock, Vera Farmiga, Myles Frost and Lennox Simms. In the end, the revelations exposed here could well make you sad for the needlessly sorry state of humanity. But the picture also provides a deeper, more insightful understanding of what’s fundamentally wrong with humanity, providing us with a key that just might help us find our way out of the current social morass with a solution that could potentially help us finally fix things for good.']]"

Police chief Martin Brody, shark hunter Quint and marine biologist Matt Hooper set sail in the hope of killing the great white monster.\nJaws is responsible for many things, it's responsible for propelling director Steven Spielberg's career into the stratosphere, it was responsible for a downturn in the package holiday trade, and it was responsible for shaping the summer blockbuster release practice's. There are many other things which one doesn't need to bore you with, it's just true to say that Jaws is firmly ensconced in movie history, if one hasn't seen it then one surely knows about it, it is, even today, part of popular culture.\nBut is it any good? Is it worthy of a long standing reputation as one of the greatest monster movies of all time? Hell yes it is, one or two easily overlooked flaws aside, it busted the box office (world wide) and tapped into a primal fear that resides in the majority of mankind, the unseen that resides in the sea.\nJaws sets out its marker right from the start with a truly shocking and attention grabbing opening sequence, from then on in Spielberg (learning from Hitchcock for sure) tweaks the tension to have the audience living on their nerves, even as character building (by way of Brody's family arc) sedates the pace, we just know that it's all relative to an extension of fear and terror that is around the next corner. After the first victims' remains are found, Brody glances out at the ocean, Spielberg perfectly framing the shot to say so much about what we are about to be witness' to. Jolts and shocks pop up from time to time to help build the unease, whilst Spielberg makes the audience wait before we even see what it is that so coldly and efficiently destroys man. Then it's the claustrophobic switch as our brave protagonists are out at sea on Quint's boat, unaware that the giant menace is now hunting them, eyes as black as death itself.\nSo many great scenes linger for all time in the memory, the entrance of Quint is a hum dinger, a mournful widow reducing Brody to a stunned realism, the Indianappolis monologue, the bigger boat! Just some of the reasons why I personally love cinema so much. The score from John Williams is as effective as any for the genre and Robert Hoyt's sound team's work furthers the unfolding dread. The cast are superb and uniformly excellent, managing to cast aside technical problems (and genuine resentments at times) to portray this story with verve and a genuine depth of feeling. Yet Roy Scheider (Brody), Robert Shaw (Quint) and Richard Dreyfuss (Hooper) were far from from original choices, Charlton Heston was wanted for the role of Brody, Sterling Hayden and Lee Marvin were both mooted for Quint, and John Voight was Spielberg's preferred choice for Hooper. Whilst Jaws author (and co screen writer here) Peter Benchley was heading for the top by asking for Newman, Redford and McQueen!! Imagine that!\nStill it all turned out well in the end because Jaws stands the test of time as one of the best films of its type. No amount of complaining about continuity and a rough looking mechanical shark will ever dim its appeal, even as I revisited it recently for the hundredth time I still got tingles all over my body. So file it alongside King Kong in the pantheon of Monster Movie Masterpieces. 10/10 always, now go enjoy your dip in the ocean.""], ['-', 'Is it safe to go back in the water? ...\nSteven Spielberg got ahold of the incredible Peter Benchley-penned novel about a giant, carnivorous Great White (dubbed ""Jaws"") who swims the ocean waters off a fictional resort town, preying on both the Island\'s locals and its visitors alike, and adaptated, for the silver screen, what would become one of the most terrifying American made thrillers to ever be released in the worldwide cinema. Exceptional filmmaking! And members of Spielberg\'s crew had the nerve to maliciously ""mock"" Jaws, by referring to it as ""Flaws"", during the filming process? All because of a few ""glitches"" in the mechanical shark? Ha! Who\'s laughing now?\nGreat screenwriting by Benchley and Gottlieb. Great composition by the legendary John Williams. Great direction by Spielberg. Phenomenal performances by Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfuss. Great supporting cast. Just...magnificent. Jaws is a magnificent film. A true classic.'], ['100%', 'Much like the shark itself, the movie starts slowly, deep down in the depths before coming to the surface to explode in pure sensationalism.\nJaws is one of those rare exceptions where high-brow art meets fun entertainment. At the time of its making, however, simply keeping its head above water was the most the cast and crew were hoping for.\nBut Spielberg had created something special. During production, no one saw it--I\'m not sure Spielberg himself saw it, but it was there. I think it was really editor Verna Fields who saw it and put it together.\nJaws begins the way most primal fears begin: someone is alone, in the dark, in an alien environment, and is being attacked from some unknown entity. People remark today how Jaws worked so well, that it\'s kept them afraid of the ocean for years. I disagree. I think it\'s because we are scared of the ocean is why Jaws works so well. The opening scene of the young girl being savaged in the black nothingness that is the night ocean is terrifying because it preys on primal fears; it doesn\'t create them.\nNext we\'re introduced to our cast of characters: There\'s Police Chief Martin Brody--an everyman with a fear of the water--and his wife, Ellen. There\'s Brody\'s loyal deputy Len Hendricks (mysteriously named ""Jeff"" in the sequel). Then, of course, there\'s the other side. There is the crooked mayor Larry Vaughan, and his two toadies newspaper editor Harry Meadows and coroner Carl Santos. After Brody and Hendricks find evidence of a hungry shark off the coast of the resort town of Amity, they do the sensible thing and start closing up the beaches. The mayor, seeing dwindling dollar signs, convinces Meadows and Santos to back him, and together they confront Brody and put the kibosh on his beach closing plan.\nIn an era where the primitive special effects technology gave us a shark that looked like a pool toy, it became essential that the shark not be the focal point of the film. And while a fin here and a barrel there do work wonders, it\'s only because the shark is far from the only villain in the movie. To have credibility, we have to have a human villain. And that is where Vaughan comes in.\nAfter Vaughan\'s cavalier ""it-can\'t-happen-again"" attitude blows up in his face, Brody brings in the book smart, but decidedly out-of-his-element marine biologist Matt Hooper. Hooper tells Brody everything he and we, the audience, already know: The shark is out there; it\'s hungry; it\'s eating people; and it will continue to do so unless it is killed.\nAfter a disastrous Fourth of July celebration that should have gotten Vaughan impeached, Brody and Hooper join forces with Quint, a grizzled fisherman with a personal vendetta against sharks. The movie then switches from its horror and drama elements and becomes something of an adventure, foreshadowing Spielberg\'s work on films like Raiders of the Lost Ark. Even John Williams\' score begins to conjure up images of Errol Flynn-style swashbuckling. The adventure almost seems fun.\nAnd that is when the shark, previously only a shadow, fin, or plot point referenced by dialogue, takes center stage. The movie shifts gears further near the end, going from adventure to a full on monster movie.\nThe build up is slow, relying on showing us the results of the shark\'s presence rather than the shark itself. This creates enough fear and credibility so that by the time the big, rubbery toy shark is commanding the screen, we\'re afraid of it. It\'s already been established as a monster.\nThe movie\'s pacing, dialogue and acting are all perfect, creating a strong enough foundation on which a silly, albeit terrifying, plot rests. By the time the shark is sinking boats and eating shark cages, Spielberg has made us by into it that he could have had the shark blasting off for the moon and we would have accepted it. And that is how and why Jaws works.'], ['80%', ""Solid shark-thriller that still holds up well with each subsequent viewings.

This alone raises the film up ½* for me - it's impressively made.\nI don't, personally, think the story is as perfect as the aforementioned. Don't get me wrong it's all entertaining, but I feel it peaks with the shark terrorising the town as a whole - when it's down to just the trio, I didn't enjoy it quite as much. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss do give notable performances, though.\nGoing back to my initial point, the effects for the shark are incredible. I kinda wanted to simply see more of just the shark, even if we do get more of the great white towards the conclusion. Heck, the film from the shark's prospective would've been 5*. Lastly, that John Williams score is sensational - I think every film fan, whether they've seen it or not, knows that famous theme.\nAlmost 47 years after its release, I've finally seen 'Jaws'.

But that also means that if they get things right for once, I can\'t just categorically disagree with them.\nAnd it\'s really not like they are just smearing this movie for no good reason. They do (for the most part) have a valid point. This movie does nothing to actually stop this crime or to help the victims or to help people recognize this crime when they see it.

Actually a lot of them are quite educated, sophisticated and female because they don\'t raise suspicion.

Issei Ogata is on hand as the sadistic, but seemingly reasonable Japanese inquisitor.\nThe Jesuits were a society of Catholic missionaries started in 1540 in response to the spreading evangelism of the Protestant reformers. They were an essential part of the Roman counter-Reformation. With this in mind, the seeming Christianity portrayed in the movie is decidedly Catholic in nature, with the requisite unbiblical stuff, like confessions to priests, icons, rosary beads, etc.\nIn tone and theme, ""Silence"" is reminiscent of movies like the excellent ""Black Robe"" (1991), the solid ""The Mission"" (1986) and the surprisingly great ""Black Death"" (see my review). There are also elements of ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1957). If you appreciate any of these films you might appreciate ""Silence,"" but it didn\'t work for me.

The biggest for me was Ezra Miller as The Flash. I did not like his effeminate, nerdy, socially awkward, and neurotic and at times cowardly take on the character. This is not the Barry Allen I grew up reading in comics or the one that has been portrayed twice in a much better fashion on television.

You can see elements of his humor scattered throughout and the film does move along at a steady pace without dragging.\nThe biggest issue is that so many of the characters are just stiff and one-dimensional. They really are not overly interesting so it is hard to really connect with them and the tasks they are facing. Unlike Marvel who have excelled with dysfunctional groups who fight amongst themselves as well as the forces of evil, this group seems to be going through the paces rather than being fully engaged with the task at hand and each other.\nIn the end “Justice League” is better than I expected, and the two bonus scenes in the credits show some interesting potential down the road.  As it is, it is flawed entertainment that requires audiences to overlook a lot of issues.\n3 stars out of 5'], ['80%', ""though thanks to bad reviews I wasn't sure about seeing this one but let me tell you my worries were put to rest very very soon this was one of the best times I have had at the movies this year the critics really missed the mark here I loved all the action and even the humor it was a good family movie as long as you have older kids due to the fact that the villans could be very frightening in spots and also this has a high level of action and it could overwhelm the youngest of kids but I still say get some snacks from the snack bar and be ready to have a super fun time at the movies with the entire family this thanksgiving weekend whether you go alone or take a group this is the movie to see""], ['80%', ""An enjoyable superhero team movie. It's really being unfairly trashed by the critics. It's not up to the excellence of this summer's Wonder Woman film, but it's quite fun to watch. What made this film better than some of the other previous DCEU films is that it has a sense of humor. Previous films were rightfully criticized for being too dark and humorless. Gal Gadot is the stand out as Wonder Woman. This film did a better job in its portrayal with Superman. In Man of Steel, he battled Zod, which resulted in massive human casualties, without a care, which does not fit the character at all. That made me mad as a Superman fan. Here, he shows concern for innocent civilians, flying away with an entire building of people to make sure they would not be harmed in the battle against the villain. The one weak spot is the Big Bad, Steppenwolf. He's a rather fake looking CGI creation that lacks depth. But he's only the precursor to the REAL villain--Darkseid. The two end credit scenes are entertaining. The last one teasing the formation of the Legion of Doom/ Injustice League is particularly intriguing.""], ['30%', 'When it was first announced that 2016 would see Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad movies, I said to myself ""Okay, I didn\'t like Man of Steel, but there\'s two very different DC entries coming up, I\'ll watch both of them, and if I like even one of them I\'m willing to give this franchise a go.""\nI didn\'t like either of them.\nMarvel had never interested me growing up.

Avoid where possible.'], ['60%', 'Our childhood superheroes all together !!\nYet again a new DC installment from one of the most controversial directors of Hollywood Zack Snyder, who directed Man of Steel (2013) and Dawn of Justice (2016). The large of number of nerds around the globe are waiting for this from the childhood to see their favorite iconic heroes team up for the first time in Cinematic history. The basic plot of movie revolves around some deadly external threat wanting to conquer earth like every other CBM adaptations. The movie offers the same story as we see in most of the fandoms where a group of lonesome warriors come together to save earth.\n“Men are still good”, deeply inspired by the Superman, Batman has again gained his faith in humanity and wants to start working for it and saving it. The Batman continuing its investigation on what Lex Luthor was planning to do in Dawn in Justice. Diana and him are uniting some new members like Victor Stone Aka Cyborg and Arthur Curry aka Aquaman and Barry Allen aka Flash in order to find their potential for good and unite against common threats when the world need it.The movie shows how people who lives alone finds it hard to adjust among new people. One of most important part of the movie is The Superman in his full character development, and showing to audience that sometimes Superhero needs other Superheroes to save them, because at the end of the day everybody loves a classic DC story where “Superman saving everyone and beating the crap out of bad guys”.\nThe performance of characters was good as the “material” was given to them. Batman which is played by Ben Affleck in JL was a bit out of character unlike the previous ones i.e. in Dawn Of Justice where he was The Freaking Bat ,The Worst Knightmare. He was purest personification of Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight, brutal, badass emotionless vigilante who everyone fears but in JL he was watered down too low and Yeah the guy smiles too. It may be horrifying to see Joker smiling but trust me its more horrifying to see Batman smiling . After her wonderful victory over RT Gal Gadot could do a lot better. Wonder Woman was kind of distracted and could not establish character as she did it in Dawn Of Justice and Wonder Woman,or may be we were expecting more. Cyborg who is a brilliant sportsman who lost his life after an accident. It was good to see Zack tried to show how life of normal human changes after horrifying accidents. The guy is in conflict with himself which is brilliantly played by Ray Fisher. Just like Ben Affleck Ezra miller too was first hated then became everyone’s favorite kid in JL. His conversations brings the tone of movie somewhat lighter. Now we have king of Atlantis, He looks like Khal Drogo had a kid with some most beautiful mermaid. Thanks to Jason Momoa ,Aquaman is total badass unlike its previous versions . I don’t want to spoil Superman but yeah Henry really nailed it.He finally became The Superman everybody wanted. His journey is complete. He knows why he is here, to save us all. We had another badass mortal on the team, He is Alfred portrayed Sir. Jeremy Irons. Actually we are not in a position to judge Sir Jeremy but yeah he was one of the best parts you will love in JL. We saw his sassy quick-witted talk with Bruce. You may find the movie is not catchy ,may be this was result of messed up situation where Zack Snyder left the movie due to his personal problems and put it in hands of other director Joss Whedon. Those two are totally different in their approaches so it resulted in such situation.\nAlthough you may find a lot of negativity about this movie like previous DC films, because one of the things that audience forgets that DC characters are very dark unlike their contrary Marvel whose characters are cheesy and kind of funny, their stories and plots revolve around words like Hope , Justice and humanity not like Shawarma or Devil’s Anus jokes .This is a average movie not an Avengers movie. One thing I want to say that they kind of rushed to create a team up rather than Solo movies of Characters. This kinds of things  makes hard for audience to adjust as they don’t bond with DC characters as easily they do with Marvel one’s. The CGI was somewhat down as compared to other CBM’s and could have been a lot better.\nOverall, the movie will attract you if you see it as first team up not if you compare with other ones. This DC movie is worth watching.'], ['40%', 'The much-anticipated Justice League, the follow-up to 2016’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, was finally released on November 17, 2017. After Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad were both negatively received, Warner Bros. saw a glimmer of hope with the highly-received Wonder Woman and hoped this would push the DCEU forward onto greatness. I saw Justice League on the 19th of November and my consensus: It’s Not Good. Opening to $94 million for its first weekend and with a 40% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, Justice League underperformed both financially and critically. 10 years ago, I would have laughed at the idea of a Guardians of the Galaxy film beating Justice League at the box office and be much better received. Justice League’s performance puts the future of the DCEU in jeopardy.\nDue to a personal tragedy in Zack Snyder’s life, he stepped down as director and Joss Whedon (director of The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron) took over post-production with reshoots and filming additional scenes. Most would have assumed that because of Joss Whedon’s reputation, he would be a great asset to the production of Justice League. However, that was strongly not the case. Zack Snyder intended to make this movie with a much lighter tone than Batman v Superman, but Zack Snyder’s style just does not blend well with Joss Whedon’s. What we’re left with is a DC film badly trying to be a Marvel film and the tone is an inconsistent mess throughout. The film loses its sense of identity and doesn’t know what tone (light or dark) it wants to incorporate. Thanks to Warner Bros. meddling with the production of the film and purposely sabotaging Zack Snyder’s vision (as much as I dislike his directing style), we’re left with a film full of sloppy editing and pacing, inconsistent tone, forgettable/unmemorable music, rushed “development” of characters, a terribly developed villain, thin plot and clunky CGI throughout.\nThe movie directly follows the death of Superman in the previous film, triggering a sense of fear in people and allowing Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons to seek the 3 Mother Boxes on Earth to trigger a mass transformation of the planet. But instead of showcasing his initial invasion on Earth, the film starts off with disjointed scenes that don’t connect with one another. First with a video recording of Superman looking like he doesn’t want to even be recorded, then jumps to Batman using a criminal to capture a Parademon, then again to Wonder Woman thwarting a terrorist plot (which has nothing to do with the overall narrative), then jumps to a fully-bearded Bruce Wayne attempting to recruit Aquaman. There is no smooth transition between scenes and just results in a jumbled mess that really doesn’t show us a sense of urgency as to why Diana and Bruce want to recruit a team of meta-humans.\nThe movie should really give us a reason as to why Steppenwolf should be feared, but instead, he is portrayed as a generic, badly rendered CGI figure that utters generic villain dialogue and just suddenly appears in Themiscyra through a Boom Tube. We are not given a scene showing who Steppenwolf is or why he’s returned to Earth before arriving to Themiscyra. While there is a scene showing Steppenwolf’s original invasion on Earth and his subsequent defeat by the combines forces of Humans, Atlanteans, Amazonians and Green Lanterns, it’s narrated by Wonder Woman and misplaced during a random moment when she’s explaining the Mother Boxes after he has invaded Themiscyra. The movie should have started off with developing a strong sense of interest for Steppenwolf and his reason for obtaining the Mother Boxes (is he doing this on his own accord or is a higher being – Darkseid – ordering him to do so?). Then show his original invasion on Earth without having Wonder Woman to tell us about Steppenwolf. Steppenwolf is basically Loki: They both wore a helmet with horns, they were both given orders by a higher being to retrieve a box (or boxes), they both commanded an army of disposable CGI monsters, they both arrived to Earth through a portal, and both attempted to conquer the world. But the big difference? Loki is actually likeable, while Steppenwolf is greatly forgettable.\nSuperman, the “beacon of hope” as described by Bruce Wayne, is nothing of the sort. He was portrayed as a strongly brooding figure in both Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, but we do not once see Superman acting as this beacon. Instead, he looked as if he hates saving people and always has a blank expression on his face. There is no sense of romance between him and Lois or him being a beacon of hope, we’re just told that and are expected to believe that. However, his character sees much improvement in Justice League. One of the aspects I enjoyed about the film was actually Superman. In the film’s climax, he actually felt and acted like the Superman we all knew and loved in the past (excluding his two previous films). His revival was quite satisfying, especially when Bruce knew he may not be the same person as before. Then we’re given a glimpse into an Evil Superman where he easily manages to take on all the Justice League members. What I especially liked was seeing The Flash attempt to run behind Superman and as he’s in the Speed Force, Superman moves his eyes and head to stare directly at Barry, catches him off-guard and he’s left with a “WTF” expression on his face. This was honestly one of the best moments of the entire film, but is very short-lived. Lois Lane comes to the rescue and seems to knock Superman out of his disoriented state and they fly back to Smallville. After some brief dialogue, Superman seems to be back to his old self. I just felt his state of mind reverting back to his original self was rushed and relied heavily on Lois Lane to do the job.\nBatman is seen as the weakest member of the Justice League and is turned into a complete joke in this film. He even utters one-liners and is a much more light-hearted character in stark contrast to his debut in Batman v Superman. It’s very out of character for Bruce Wayne/Batman to be this way. It makes him seem like the DC equivalent of Tony Stark. It’s also apparent that Ben Affleck wants to no longer play Batman, I can totally tell that he just doesn’t seem to care anymore about the role. But he is given terrible material to work with, and I can understand why he would want to stop playing the role. I just hope Ben Affleck can see a glimmer of hope in the upcoming Batman solo reboot.\nNot much to say about Wonder Woman, since her solo film was spectacular and she continued to be damn amazing in this film, but I was utterly disgusted that DC felt it was necessary to overly-sexualize her by capturing close shots of her chest and ass. They even get up-skirt shots of her. It undermines her character established in her solo film and delegates her to being mere eye candy in the eyes of men. Plus the terrorist plot she thwarted, though it was an awesome moment, has no purpose and was a waste of screen time.\nCyborg is easily the least interesting character of the group. There’s brief development that I assume he holds resentment towards his father for bringing him back as “monster.” We’re not given an inner struggle with Cyborg struggling to deal with the fact of his condition, but the film has to quickly gloss over the Justice League members introduced in Batman v Superman via e-mail attachment in order to form the team. His only shining moment is in the final battle where he is the only one that can separate the Mother Boxes before Steppenwolf can enact his plan. But in Batman v Superman, from the video file, it seemed as if the Mother Box fused with Cyborg, so why is the box still a separate entity? It should have been fused with Cyborg and would raise the stakes a bit higher because Steppenwolf could use Cyborg to fuse with the other Mother Boxes and would force the Justice League to do everything in their power to save him.\nEzra Miller’s The Flash seems to be DC’s response to Tom Holland’s Spider-Man. However, The Flash is a much worse version of Spider-Man with very cringe-worthy dialogue. He’s socially awkward and without hesitation, he immediately agrees to join Bruce Wayne for the reason of wanting friends. What the hell? We saw some development with Barry Allen striving to prove his father’s innocence, but why join the Justice League for the sole purpose of making friends? Plus he even explains to Batman that he has never been in a battle, yet he was shown to be the one that apprehended Captain Boomerang. He is never given a shining moment except for saving a family in Russia and challenging Superman to a race in the mid-credits scene.\nJason Momoa as Aquaman was actually amazing, though he is bogged down by very limited screen time and little to no development. It honestly makes me quite excited for the upcoming Aquaman solo film slated for release late-2018. But a major annoyance I had with Aquaman was that he completely disappears from the movie after fighting off Steppenwolf, then suddenly reappears when the team is fighting Steppenwolf and Parademons in the sewers. There is no explanation as to how he arrived to the sewers, he just appears there. And that is the only time we truly see his powers is when he stops a column of water from flushing them out. In the final battle, they are nowhere near a water source, so what good is Aquaman if he cannot use his powers? However, it leaves me wanting to know more about Aquaman. Despite those annoyances, I thought the scene where Aquaman is unknowingly sitting on the Lasso of Truth and starts to speak the truth about their situation was fantastic and quite humorous, especially his reaction to when he realizes he was sitting on the lasso.\nThe final battle between Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons against the Justice League has very low stakes and takes place in an obscure location in Russia. Unlike The Avengers, where the battle took place in New York and resulted in severe collateral damage, which raised the stakes a lot, Justice League’s climax doesn’t have a sense of world-ending urgency. It’s just a giant CGI battle with the only memorable moment being Aquaman riding a Parademon through a building. There’s no shining moments like Hulk slamming Loki or Hawkeye jumping off the building and shooting at the Chitauri as he’s falling. As Cyborg is struggling to separate the Mother Boxes, Superman appears when all hope seems to be lost and absolutely beats the shit out of Steppenwolf, breaking his weapon and his own Parademons attack him since they smell his fear of defeat. It made Steppenwolf seem like nothing but a giant push-over. But what especially irks me is that the original plan was to have Steppenwolf attempt to sway Superman to join him, Superman is given an apocalyptic vision( similar to the one Batman saw) and he actually sees Darkseid and this snaps Superman out of it and he delivers the final blow to defeat Steppenwolf.\nThough it’s a competent film and I really wanted to enjoy this film, Justice League is a complete let-down that should have been a huge movie event. Given its box office numbers and critical reception, this puts the future of the DCEU in a troubling position. They really should have given each of the heroes a solo film before releasing Justice League, but it’s apparent that Warner Bros. was way more concerned with catching up with Marvel than actually developing a shared universe with well-developed characters. Justice League just did not resonate with me and we can mainly thank Warner Bros. for rushing this film and delivering a disappointing product.\nClosing Comments \n- When Cyborg links up to the Nightcrawler, Alfred asks him if he knows him. Alfred and Diana were in the Batcave together when Cyborg reached out to them, Alfred should have recognized his voice completely.\n- Steppenwolf should have been a much better-developed villain with a well-defined purpose.\n- Mixing the styles of two directors in this film gave it a wildly inconsistent tone. \n- The humor, thought it did lighten up the mood, doesn’t work well with Zack Snyder’s style and feels out of place. \n- What was the deal with putting so much focus on that Russian family? It takes you out of the element of the final battle and is a cheap attempt at raising the stakes.\n- When Steppenwolf was first defeated thousands of years ago, why did they all entrust the humans with a Mother Box? Shouldn’t the Green Lantern Corps be alerted that one of their own perished in the battle? They could have taken the Mother Box back with them, but they didn’t.\n- Overall, the movie suffers from trying to do too much with too little time. DC really needs to reevaluate their future releases and as much as we all want another Justice League, they should put all their focus on standalone titles to fully flesh out their characters for now.\n- That post-credits scene featuring Slade Wilson/Deathstroke visiting a recently escaped and bald Lex Luthor is a set-up for the Injustice League/Legion of Doom, which would make for an interesting idea for the Justice League sequel (if it does happen).\nRating: 4/10'], ['90%', 'This was my type of Super Hero movie. Simple, straightforward plot without much social nonsens and preaching. Little in terms of the all too common whining and sel pitying by the heroes. They are heroes all the way without any nonsensical vendettas or moral bullshit (mostly).

Well, go watch another movie then for Christ sake! News Flash: It is a Super Hero movie! There are supposed to be a shitload of CGI in a super hero movie.

There are a few comical moments but luckily they are not overdone. Aquaman accidentally sitting on Wonder Woman’s “truth lasso” was quite hilarious actually.\nThe SF was generally great. I really liked the explosive action scenes. The colorful tendrils that invaded the land around Steppenwolf’s lair was a bit si-so though. They should have kept them just black and red at least.\nSteppenwolf himself was okay. From a distance he was pretty great but up close (and there was really too many up close scenes of him) he looked…not so great, especially when talking.\nThere are a couple of stupid faults of course. Usually involving the good guys just standing around looking while the bad guy screws them. Leaving the, obviously, all important third mother box unguarded and the lust looking stupid when Steppenwolf grabbed it was a real low.\nAnyway, I really liked this movie.

The result was Seven, a dark masterpiece of unremitting creeping dread that showcased the work of a clinically excellent director. Seven is not just a movie, it\'s an experience, an assault on the senses, a jolt to the brain, a trawl through the dark recess of some sick city where it always rains and the darkness holds many fears.

This killer is not only unstoppable in perpetrating his violent crimes, he is, as Freeman\'s weary retirement bound Detective Somerset says, methodical and patient. It\'s going to end bad, the cops know it and so do we, and that\'s when Fincher and Walker stick their hands into our guts and pull out the last semblance of solids to deliver one of the greatest endings of modern cinema. An ending fit to grace any noir, neo-noir or smart ass psychological horror movie from across the ages. With each viewing of Seven there\'s the repeating wave of bleak emotions that come as the reversed end credits roll, desolation and disbelief, sadness and shock, our trip through earthly hell is over, but only in the psychical sense!\nFaultless cast performances, no doubt eked out by what we now know is a task-master director, photography that brilliantly brings to ""light"" the melancholic sheen of a decaying society and a Howard Shore score that crawls out of the speakers and cloaks your body like some evil Incubus or Succubus.

The crime scenes are so grisly Seven is often ranked with top horror movies. And the ending -- hoo boy. One of the best twists in modern movie history.'], ['100%', 'If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\nI\'ve never written or even thought about my favorite movies of all-time. I don\'t believe in having a definite Top10 or Top20 of every film I\'ve ever seen. However, if I had to write this special list, I have no doubts that Se7en would be there. Obviously, this is a rewatch of the classic movie that impacted filmmaking and launched David Fincher\'s remarkable career (I also ignore the fact that Alien 3 is connected to Fincher due to the known production issues). With his next film, Mank, coming up on Netflix in a few weeks, I decided to go through part of his filmography. Se7en will be the first out of five Fincher\'s movies that I will be able to revisit throughout this week.\nI\'ve seen this film countless times, but to be completely honest, I haven\'t seen it in so long that I didn\'t remember exactly some important plot points and a key component about the ending. This helped me experience Se7en in a fascinating way once again. Andrew Kevin Walker\'s screenplay has one of the most intriguing, mysterious, captivating narratives I\'ve ever witnessed, still to this day. From the very beginning to the last second, I\'m constantly at the edge of my seat (in this case, my couch) with severe anxiety levels and feeling incredibly tense. Biting my nails, moving my leg up and down, changing positions… it\'s so mesmerizing that I\'m only writing about it more than twenty-four hours after I watched it.\nOne of the most impressive aspects is how Fincher is able to leave the viewer uncomfortable with showing only a single death on-screen. This is an extremely dark, gory, blood-soaked, gruesome flick, packed with horrible displays of dead bodies, but never the actual murder scene. With just a simple photo or a straight line of dialogue, Fincher lets the viewer\'s imagination do the work, and it\'s undoubtedly as or more effective than a visually horrific killing sequence. As the premise implies, the serial killer is inspired by the ""seven deadly sins"", and he goes after the respective sinners, killing them (or letting them kill themselves) in an innovative fashion, turning the sin against the sinner.\nThe gluttony and sloth cases are visually brutal, but the lust murder is the one that keeps haunting my memory. The latter is also the less explicit, left to open-minded people to imagine the despicable act. In 1995, a movie with such a dismal environment and dark story couldn\'t be well-received, and Se7en got its fair share of negative reviews stating that it was too obscure, sinister, overly violent and that the ending was absolutely unacceptable. Over time, it found its success, it gained fans all around the world, and it\'s now considered by many as one of the greatest films ever made, myself included. From the outstanding cast to the astonishingly enthralling detective work, the third act stands out as one of the most shocking endings of all-time.\nI\'m keeping this review spoiler-free because I don\'t want readers who have not seen this movie to have such a magnificent piece of cinema ruined for them. That\'s why I\'m also hiding a certain actor from the starring section, just like the marketing team did at the original date of release (I\'ll get there). Fincher\'s third act is simply flawless. Everything displayed on-screen in the last twenty minutes is filmmaking perfection. From the impressively suspenseful build-up to that jaw-dropping climactic moment, passing through a mind-blowing revelation, Se7en\'s conclusion is and will remain as one of the most brutally shocking endings in the history of cinema.\nMorgan Freeman and Brad Pitt share fantastic chemistry, portraying two iconic characters that couldn\'t be more different than one another. Somerset is a notable detective with extreme attention to detail, knowledgeable, and always curious about the case at hand. Freeman incorporates this character effortlessly, delivering a subtle yet powerful performance. Pitt portrays Mills, a childish, unfocused, immature replacement to the previous detective about to retire. Despite its apparent lack of work ethics, Mills is clever, relentless in finding the killer, and desperately wants to prove himself. Pitt, just like Freeman, embodies this persona seamlessly and also gives an outstanding interpretation.\nTechnically, where should I begin? From the haunting score of Howard Shore to the documentary-like cinematography (Darius Khondji) that offers a tremendously realistic atmosphere, it\'s the phenomenal production design that stands out. Fincher really wanted the dirty, rainy, depressing city to feel authentic and as real as possible. The first dialogues of the film are meant to point out the bleakness and awfulness of the city, but even without these conversations, any viewer will be able to acknowledge the absence of color, joyfulness, and life in this unknown location. Fincher\'s filmmaking techniques are demonstrated in plain splendor for everyone to see, and this was just his beginning.\nMovies like Se7en are impossible to be made today, period. It would never be conceivable to completely hide one of the main actors from the press tour and/or trailers. We live in a time where the promotion of a film must have everything and everyone. Nowadays, trailers show way too much, and this isn\'t news to anyone. The ending was forced by Pitt and Fincher since the studio wanted a more mainstream conclusion. Today, filmmakers may have more freedom, but there are still countless cases of executive producers changing a movie without the director\'s will and/or permission. Se7en was a film released in a time where it should have never been released in the first place. Fortunately, it was.\nSe7en might be the best director\'s sophomore movie in the history of cinema, and it\'s undoubtedly one of my favorite films of all-time. David Fincher\'s classic possesses one of the most captivating screenplays I\'ve ever witnessed, marked by an extremely dark, somber, violent, gruesome story that ends with one of the most emotionally shocking conclusions to a movie, ever. The lack of on-screen death scenes is both the most surprising and effectively powerful element of the whole film, leaving the unpleasant work of imagining a specific type of murder to the viewer\'s mind. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are extraordinary as the now iconic detectives, delivering two truly brilliant performances. Fincher\'s trademark filmmaking style started here, as every technical aspect contributes to the movie\'s incredible realism. From the simple, documentary-like camera work to the ominous score, it\'s the authentic production design that sets the depressing tone, the bleak atmosphere, and the rainy, colorless, lifeless city. Overall, it\'s a technically flawless piece of art. One of the greatest films ever made…. I can\'t recommend it more.\nRating: A+'], ['30%', 'Some creative kills and a decent atmosphere fail to obscure a vapid nihilism, rather meandering plot with a twist that makes little sense, and some quite nasty misogyny.

Perhaps it has to do with the 56-year-old Tom Cruise who defies age and pushes his physical boundaries for our viewing pleasure? The answer is quite evident in ‘Fallout’ as his Ethan Hunt is as good as a caped superhero in the sixth film of the series. The story isn't all that new with its twists and turns. But ‘Fallout’ manages to build on the previous films in the series by bringing back old friends and foes, besides adding some new ones. Henry Cavill as August Walker fits right into this universe as the hammer to the scalpel that is Ethan Hunt. His presence is looming enough to fill the entire screen whenever he appears. Simon Pegg takes on the status of a series regular alongside Ving Rhames, whose Benji and Luther respectively play more than just mere sidekicks as they add comic levity and heart. Alec Baldwin and Angela Bassett also make a mark in their brief appearances but watch out for impactful turns by Rebecca Ferguson and Michelle Monaghan along the way.\nWriter & Director Christopher McQuarrie allows each character to shine while building on their history with each other, thus making them endearing to the audience. This only serves to up the ante when they’re in danger. McQuarrie also lets the story breathe by bringing some calm before the storm hits. Which leads to the most crucial aspect of the series, and one that McQuarrie clearly excels at in this film – the action sequences. Not only are they meticulously planned; they are executed with precision, even when the fist fights are gritty and gruesome. Rob Hardy beautifully choreographs the camerawork following these intricate set-pieces, either allowing you to take in the expanse or bringing you up close and personal when required. This is paired with a soundtrack by Lorne Balfe that lends to the tension by giving the iconic ‘Mission Impossible’ theme a sinister sense of urgency.\nMcQuarrie has now directed two ‘Mission: Impossible’ films; his understanding of the franchise and its characters proves to be the secret weapon of the series. The fact that the stunts are largely done with practical effects featuring the cast, and most prominently Cruise himself, sets a whole new standard for action films. ‘Mission: Impossible – Fallout’ is a great mix of plot, pacing and performances that is undeniably the best entry in the franchise, while it re-establishes Cruise’s status as an action superstar.\nReview by Times of India (TOI)\nFinal Rating - 4.0/5""], ['60%', 'Mission Impossible - Fallout is a continuation of Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation.

No political bullshit, betrayal of the team and such like nonsense.\nHowever, in pretty much every movie Ethan or the entire IMF team was betrayed or set up and he had to, not only complete his mission but, clear IMF from whatever shenanigans the story writers had dreamed up. The movies have been Mission Impossible in name only. I wonder if the moron script writers has ever watched the show.\nIn this movie too there is indeed a bunch of political nonsense and betrayal. Shit that I could be without. But at least IMF and Ethan’s team are on his side throughout the movie. There are also a few clever parts where they trick the bad guys in a good old fashioned Mission Impossible style.\nOtherwise the movie is mostly a classical Hollywood action adventure/thriller movie. Plenty of, more or less, non stop action. There are a few of the usual WTF story holes and defiance of physics when it comes to the stunts of course.

The first twenty minutes are poor; predictable and formulaic and I will admit to having started to write it off, Once Henry Cavill (""August Walker"") joins the gang, however, and they start to search for the missing cores it becomes fast-moving, action-packed and enjoyable - with plenty of crosses and double-crosses. Rebecca Ferguson still always comes across the same, whomever she plays, but that works for this one and the team spirit really comes across. Sure, it isn\'t going to win a Booker for the writing, but it travels the world showing off some fine locations (many of which are actually left intact, afterwards!!) before heading to an exciting denouement with helicopters and Cruise\'s favourite mountain-top pinnacle combat.

It's my favourite movie of the year too, but I've only seen like ten or so 2019 releases, and this is the 22nd Marvel Cinematic Universe film, so that seems far and away the bigger deal. I can't say it's perfect, there's some conflicting stuff within its own runtime that really doesn't seem to gel (though a re-watch may prove me wrong on that), and it's not like every moment was the no-holds-barred-zero-exception best version of that moment from start to end.

Last year’s “Avengers: Infinity War” set the stage for the highly-anticipated conclusion; “Avengers: End Game” and at long last it has arrived.\nPicking up shortly after the events of the last film, the Avengers must deal with the aftermath of what Thanos has done. The team is naturally divided between wanting revenge, wanting to set things right, and just wanting to take what they have and go on.\nAs time passes and they struggle to accept the reality of their situation; an unexpected individual returns and with them comes the seeds of a new plan to make things right. Naturally Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is skeptical but eventually warms to the possibilities of the idea thanks to a new scientific breakthrough that makes it possible.\nInspired, Tony sets out to put an elaborate plan in motion that will allow the team to try to fix things and to stop Thanos once and for all.\nWhat follows is an extended and at times nostalgic heist where various members of the team work to assemble the pieces needed for the plan as they believe they only have one chance to make things right.\nThe film is essentially three acts in one. The first deals with the recap and expansion of their situation and the planning. The second act is basically a heist where action and comedy are blended with some touching moments.\nThis all leads to the final act which is the FX laden set piece where the ensemble cast gathers to fight the forces of evil in a battle to save the Universe.\nThe film is epic in scale and length as it clocks in at over three hours but the movie is filled with so much content that the time goes by quickly and you have a hard time believing three hours have elapsed.\nIt is also a difficult film to review as you cannot recap elements of the film in any great detail without giving away elements that are sure to delight the fans. Suffice it to say that my only real issue with the fil and it was minor; was that it took a while to get to the action but at least there was plenty to keep you entertained along the way.\nAs this phase of the Marvel Film Universe winds down and plans are put in place for the next five years; “Avengers: End Game” is a satisfying conclusion to the epic saga that was started many years ago and weaves elements of many of the past Marvel films into an entertaining tale which features all of the best elements that have made the series of films such big hits.\n4.5 stars out of 5'], ['100%', 'If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\nDon\'t worry. This is going to be a pretty vague review. Right now, as I\'m writing this sentence, I\'m still processing what I saw and how am I going to explain how I felt without spoiling a single tiny thing. First of all, it\'s such a mix of feelings. On one hand, I\'m extremely happy that I was lucky to be alive during this epic time and that I was able to follow these characters that I love and care about so much. On the other hand, I\'m obviously sad that it finally reached the end of this (hopefully) first incredible saga. There are no perfect films and one with so many heroes will always have struggles balancing it all (Infinity War already had this issue).\nHowever, the Russo brothers did everything they could to deliver a phenomenal story, and they did. I don\'t think this could have been any better. Its last hour exceeds any expectations. It\'s epic, emotional, action-heavy, and it has one of my favorite shots in the entire history of cinema. It\'s pure magic, and the VFX team will surely get an Oscar for it. The action reminded me of the biggest Lord of the Rings\' battles, and it was impeccably filmed, filled with riveting and chill-inducing sequences. Nevertheless, don\'t expect this high-intensity feeling throughout the whole runtime. The other two acts are a slow-burn build-up to a payoff that\'s going to make you pretty much either ""love"" or ""like"" this movie. I absolutely love it!\nThis is easily one of the best MCU films, if not my new number one. I can\'t deny that the 3-hour runtime has some unnecessary scenes, but even if they don\'t have a significant impact on the plot or even in the characters, they still contribute to the enormous build-up. Seeing this family that we grew up with just talking with each other or having lunch, at the same time that they deal with the consequences of Thanos\' snap, is inexplicably captivating and heartwarming. Characters like Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) and Steve (Chris Evans) supporting each other is simply beautiful. Their comradery and chemistry are worthy of some tears here and there.\nSome people didn\'t really enjoy Infinity War so much due to the lack of screentime that some characters had. This time around, there are fewer characters to work with, so the balance is better. Everyone gets an important role, from Captain America to Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) to Nebula (Karen Gillan), and even Rocket (Bradley Cooper). Every single character has a major moment. If you take one out of the movie, it just doesn\'t work anymore. This is not only great work from the directors, but also from the writers.\nChristopher Markus and Stephen McFeely are not even going to be remembered because fans will always think of the cast first. Most of them will also remember the directors. But the writers?! If I stand at the door of the theater at the end of the film and question everyone about who are the writers, I strongly believe most of the audience won\'t know. Every dialogue, every sentence, every word carries so much impact on the narrative. Literally, I cried and got chills just by hearing two freaking words with the perfect timing in between. The amount of grief that the words of the ones who\'ve lost everyone and everything carry is palpable and, for me, those are the most emotional moments of the movie: seeing how everyone is suffering from their own losses, not the deaths themselves.\nThe humor is mostly on-point, but it\'s still connected to my only real issue with the film, which is the second act\'s tone. From the moment the team decides what to do, we already know that this is a 1 in 14 million chance of success like Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) said, so the stakes and pressure are massive! With this level of tension, I didn\'t expect such an “easygoing” and “funny” vibe throughout, except for one particular sequence. They do a great job once again of pairing up certain Avengers together, but most of them go through these too comedic plot points for such a crucial and serious mission. Fortunately, this act carries enough action and emotional drive to make this problem not that big of an issue.\nVisually, this is arguably the best-looking superhero film ever. From the mind-blowing visual effects to the gorgeous cinematography, everything is perfect. The costumes are gritty and muddy when our heroes are in a battle, their faces are all filled with blood, and I have no words to describe how jaw-dropping that last act is. I can\'t wait to change my desktop wallpaper once THAT shot is available. I dropped a single tear just by looking at it. No one talks, no one does anything. It\'s just an amazingly beautiful image. The score is epic as hell. So much that I\'m listening to it right now as I\'m writing this review, and I\'m getting chills all over my body.\nI can\'t really write much more, to be honest. I will acknowledge the cast because they are brilliant. Each and every single member delivers an outstanding performance, but if I had to choose the ones that both surprised me and had the most impact on me, they would be Johansson\'s, Evans\', and Robert Downey Jr\'s (Tony Stark / Iron Man). “New” characters like Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) blend seamlessly, and the payoff is unbelievably satisfying. In terms of predictability, it goes more or less as I expected, but it still carries a few surprises throughout. Nothing is ever like we imagine or theorize about, so expect the unexpected, and don\'t judge a movie by if it fits your crazy, unrealistic theories that never crossed the producers and directors\' minds in the first place!\nAll in all, I don\'t know what to do now. The only thing I\'m sure of is that I want to see it again, as soon as possible. The last hour is f*cking insane. I couldn\'t fall asleep properly because I couldn\'t stop thinking about it. Endgame surpasses all expectations. It\'s everything I wished for and so much more. I could easily spend a whole day at the movie theater and watch three sessions in a row. It\'s that good. One of the best comic-book films of all-time, without a single doubt. Thank you to Kevin Feige and everyone who worked hard to bring the MCU to where it stands now. I can\'t even think of how are they going to produce something at the level of Infinity Saga. Maybe they never will. Maybe we\'ll have to wait another decade or two for something like this. Until then, see you at the next Endgame screening! Enjoy! Oh and #DontSpoilTheEndgame!\nPS: it\'s not a perfect movie, I know. It doesn\'t exist one. Yes, Endgame has some issues regarding its pacing and tone, but I would be lying to myself if this isn\'t everything I dreamed of. I felt the same way with Civil War, regarding the rating to give, and I ended up giving it an A after a first viewing. As soon as I watched the second time, I changed it to an A+.

Very cool action and FX indeed.\nThere were some silly plot holes of course. As always when writers resort to time travel. An obvious one would of course be that, when they knew they only had enough Pym particles to complete one trip for each person why did they just not go back in time to get more the first thing they did? Especially since they later did exactly that.

He has never been one of my favorite characters so I do not really care much about him being around or not but that rubbish sob-scene where he hands over his shield to a “politically correct” person was really unnecessary. I guess it must have been put there to appease the Marvel SJW retards.\nAnyway, my bottom line is that I was greatly entertained by this movie.

Also, the runtime (longest horror movie ever?!) definitely left me wondering how a horror flick could have the same duration of some of the most epic films in cinema…\nWell, I got to be honest: I’m disappointed. It’s not a bad movie, at all, but it doesn’t even come close to its predecessor’s heels. I disagree with some headlines I’ve read though. Some say the comedy was misplaced, taking away impact from emotional or dark moments. There’s barely a moment where it was expected seriousness and laughter kicked in instead, but when it does occur, it actually works. I just think it wasn’t as funny as the previous film, overall. Granted, Bill Hader as Richie Tozier is hilarious, and a perfect cast as an adult Finn Wolfhard. His chemistry with James Ransone (Eddie Kaspbrak) resembles the one Wolfhard, and Jack Dylan Grazer had, therefore this/these duo(s) being the comedy highlight.\nSome say the movie is too long. Now, this is a tricky one. Usually, when people feel bored or not as entertained as they wanted to be, they tend to blame it on the film’s runtime, especially if it’s over 100 minutes. I agree that the movie FEELS long, but I disagree that the runtime is too long.

The problem here is that not all of them are explored in a way that’s funny, scary, or just captivating enough. The fact that Jessica Chastain’s (Beverly Marsh) sequence with the old lady is entirely displayed in one of the trailers (and consequently shown at every single screening) doesn’t help the pacing.\nThe first act is pretty decent. As expected, it shows us where everyone is, what they’re doing for a living, and how they get back together. During this act, it’s pretty clear that Muschietti is going to give time to develop each character and follow their respective arcs to the end, hence the lengthy runtime. However, the second act falls flat. Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy / Jaeden Martell) has the most emotionally impactful storyline, one that affects the main plot, making the time that is spent with him worth it. Same goes for Richie’s subplot. On the opposite side, the rest of the group doesn’t have entertaining sequences or new developments whatsoever.\nBeverly continues to be affected by her childhood of abuse from her father. Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan / Jeremy Ray Taylor) keeps being in love with Bev. Eddie is still a whiny little “kid” who’s scared of everything that might make him ill. Stanley Uris (Andy Bean / Wyatt Oleff) doesn’t do anything, and Mike Hanlon is surprisingly the engine that moves the plot forward, which is a problem of its own since I never really cared for that character (he was definitely the one put aside in the 2017’s movie). Honestly, he just serves as an exposition device considering he spends the whole time just explaining everything the audience needs to know to understand where the film is going.\nFinally, the third act is a mixed bag. While it does provide a climactic ending with a sweet message, it feels very much like its predecessor. I don’t want to spoil anything, but it’s incredibly repetitive comparing to the first movie. Considering all things together, it’s a big letdown since it feels like the exact same film, but with older versions of the characters. Obviously, each of them has a different arc in this one, something the first didn’t have the time to explore, but looking at the main story, it’s pretty much the exact same thing, including how it ends (just with a minor twitch). Nevertheless, the performances are all great…\nJames McAvoy continues his streak of amazing displays, and Bill Hader has to be the MVP for the range he demonstrates. I wish Skarsgård had more time to shine as Pennywise, though. In 2017, I thought he really nailed the character and made it his own. Unfortunately, this time around, Pennywise doesn’t have that much screentime (such a disappointment), and when it appears, it often looks too CGI-ish, taking away from the gripping performance of its actor. The finale has almost no Bill Skarsgård since there’s so much CGI. Despite that, I congratulate the team(s) behind the makeup, hairstyling, costume, and production design. Derry looks terrific, and the time jumps between the young and the old gang worked seamlessly partially due to these visual achievements.\nAndy Muschietti knows how to work a camera, and the movie is very well-shot. However, he should have been able to come up with creative sequences to deliver a different level of entertainment, especially during the tiresome second act. Gary Dauberman’s screenplay is clever, and it brings this enormous story to a fitting conclusion, but he also could have imagined some new ideas for some of the characters. There are a couple of great sequences though, especially one with Bill going through a theme park tent with illusions.\nIn the end, It Chapter Two fails to deliver a conclusion worthy of its epic runtime. Even with a phenomenal cast, it isn’t as funny, as scary or even as captivating as its predecessor. Its runtime is appropriated having in mind that each character has a personal arc, but only a couple of them are genuinely compelling and entertaining. Therefore, the film feels too long, uneven, and it could have used a bit more creativity when it comes to its climactic finale. Its central story feels very similar to the last movie, its scary sequences are nowhere near the quality seen before, and even though the costume and production design are top-notch, there’s excessive use of CGI on Pennywise. It still carries some emotionally convincing moments, as well as a couple of cool sequences. Overall, it’s … okay.\nRating: C'], ['90%', ""It's the love story between Richie and Eddie that makes this movie worth viewing twice. Looking forward to the conclusion!""], ['70%', ""A pretty odd choice too undercut every scare in the movie, but I was less disappointed with Chapter Two than everyone else seems to be.

The 90's version had it moments, but I find some scenes unintentionally funny where it reeked of early Stephen King adaptations. 2017 was surprisingly good and a massive improvement, but laid back on cheap thrills.\n‘IT: Chapter Two’ was a tough act to follow up on after the monster success of the first and with the second chapter being the hardest to adapt. I thought the movie both succeeds and stumbles in parts. Although reflecting back makes it feel more like a parody than a serious horror movie. An epic finale that ended in a over the top fashion - with themes of childhood trauma and the idea of holding on to the past despite growing up with age are sprinkled through out. The loser club are all grown up now and returning home to kill IT.\nWhoever cast the grow up version of the loser club deserves massive praise here, because it’s pitch perfect casting and I could definitely see the child stars growing up to be the adult stars. James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Jay Ryan, and Isaiah Mustafa were all great in bringing the more dramatic aspects to the film. While Bill Hader and James Ranson bring the comedic aspects, but not to say they weren't dramatic as well, even making me tear up at one point.\nBill Skarsgard was truly amazing as Pennywise. The physicality in his movement has a certain silliness that you would expect to see from a clown, yet predatory with his animal-like attacks with drool running down his mouth and eyes staring in opposite directions despite looking straight at you. I find the dancing clown incredibly terrifying whenever he becomes playful and kind to deceive children.\nAndy Muschietti truly shines as a director when it comes to bizarre imagery and unsettling camera angles, while also capturing some real emotions through the lens. The opening scene at the bridge where a homophobic attack takes place was really brutal and starts the movie off strong - on par with the Georgie meets Pennywise scene in the first movie.\nDespite the run time being nearly three hours long, but I can’t recall ever being bored. It moved at a even pace in my opinion. I guess a few scenes could’ve been cut as most of it is unused footage from the first movie. Although it would be difficult to cut scenes as everything follows up to the next scene and that emotional punch towards the end wouldn’t be earned.\nNow for the issues:\nHenry Bowers was completely pointless in this movie and was only used for jump scars. Same thing with Mike, who through out these movies has nothing to do and the important things he did in the book was given to different characters.\nI didn’t like how Stan’s suicide was handle, because you find out he actually “sacrificed” himself to save the others.\nSome of the humor didn’t always land, especially if it’s right after a tense scene where it kinda deflates the horror. At times I struggled to gasp what the film marker was going for in certain scenes. Is this scene suppose to be scary or funny? Both maybe?\nI wish there was more practical work for the monster scenes instead of CGI, because at times it looked really terrible. The finale battle at the end could’ve been in a video game boss fight.""], ['80%', ""A step down, but 'It Chapter Two' is still a very good film.\nIt is, I will say, overly long, it did bore me a little at the midway point; not in a necessarily negative way, I just wanted more.

I love the characters, whether it be in this film or the preceding entry.\nJessica Chastain and Bill Hader are great choices to play the older versions of Sophia Lillis and Finn Wolfhard, they are very convincing casts.

It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.\nThere was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn\'t give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.\nIt\'s possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that\'s dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it\'s the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.\nThose in support aren\'t faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there\'s Roger Deakins\' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman\'s score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy\'s state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.\nIf you love Shawshank then it\'s a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10'], ['60%', 'Make way for the best film ever made people.

This statement is worthy of investigation for several reasons.\nFellowship is indeed merely an opening salvo, and even after three hours in the dark you will likely exit the cinema ravenous with anticipation for the further two parts of the trilogy. Fellowship is also unabashedly rooted in the fantasy genre. Not to be confused with the techno-cool of good science fiction, nor even the cutesy charm of family fare like Harry Potter, the territory of Tolkien is clearly marked by goo and goblins and gobbledegook. Persons with an aversion to lines such as, “To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!” are as well to stay within the Shire-like comforts of home (their loss).\nWith those caveats in place, it bears repeating: fantasy does not come finer. There are electrifying moments — notably the computer-assisted swooping camera through Isengard as it transforms into a factory for evil — when Jackson’s flight of fancy approaches the sublime as the romantic poets would understand it: inspiring awe.\nLeaving aside the thorny issue of Tolkien die-hards and their inevitable gripes — “What no Tom Bombadil?” — Jackson’s screenplay (written in collaboration with Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens) is both bolder and more judicious than Steven Kloves’ surprisingly timid retread of Harry Potter. In particular, rescuing the romance of Arwen and Aragorn from the footnotes and the elevation of Saruman to all-action bad guy actually has a corrective influence on Tolkien’s often oblique and female-sparse source material.\nThere are problems, though. The three-hour running time is high on incident and low on discernible form. After successive detours to Elf habitats Rivendell (the watery home of Elrond) and Lothlórien (the forest home of the Lady Galadriel), the uninitiated might well ask why these crazy Elf kids can’t just live together and spare us all this attenuated dramatic structure.\nMore importantly, the action clearly climaxes in the desperate flight from the Mines Of Moria, where the largely seamless SFX is showcased in the best possible light — total darkness — but the narrative demands a different, downbeat ending. Indeed, but for some fine emotional playing from Bean, Mortensen, Astin and Wood, the final fight might feel like a particularly brutal game of paintball in Bluebell Wood. But then, the real battles are yet to come...\nVerdict - Putting formula blockbusters to shame, Fellowship is impeccably cast and constructed with both care and passion: this is a labour of love that never feels laboured. Emotional range and character depth ultimately take us beyond genre limitations, and it deserves to play as wide as a certain Mr. Potter.\n5/5'], ['100%', 'An epic movie if I ever saw one. Captivating and just plain fun to watch. This movie is, indeed, art.'], ['70%', 'Tolkien’s adventure/fantasy LOOKS and SOUNDS fabulous, but is not without flaws.\nRELEASED 2001 and directed by Peter Jackson, “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring” adapts the first part of JRR Tolkien’s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The story starts in the homeland of the Hobbits (innocent, diminutive humanoids) where Frodo (Elijah Wood) is instructed by the noble wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to quickly leave the Shire with the powerful One Ring in his possession. Gandalf and Frodo are later accompanied by seven others, the titular ‘Fellowship of the Ring,’ to take the ring to the only place it can be destroyed, the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor.\nThe rest of the main cast include Sean Astin (Sam), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), Sean Bean (Boromir), Christopher Lee (Saruman), Orlando Bloom (Legolas), John Rhys-Davies (Gimli) and Hugo Weaving (Elrond).\nThis three-hour fantasy features a diverse cast of colorful characters, quaint beings and settings, moments of genuine wonder, dark ee-vil creatures, high adventure, thrilling brutal action, a superb score, magnificent locations (forests, mountains, rivers, etc.), and wondrous CGI sets. The film LOOKS and SOUNDS so great that it’d be sinful to give it a lower rating.\nThere are problems, however, at least for those who aren’t uber-fans of Tolkien. For one, the opening is hindered by prologue that is overlong and convoluted, not to mention unnecessary. The bulk of it could’ve been conveyed later via flashback, which they do a little bit anyway. Secondly, the story takes forever to build any drive. Thirdly, except for maybe Frodo and Gandalf, the characters are shallow and I didn’t care much what happened to them. Fourthly, main protagonists getting seriously wounded and everyone else expressing their melodramatic concern gets redundant.\nFifthly, there are only two females in the main cast (Liv Tyler as Arwen, a half-Elf princess, and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, a royal Elf); unfortunately, their parts aren’t much more than glorified cameos. “Mythica: A Quest for Heroes” (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $93 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story.\nDespite these negatives, “The Fellowship of the Ring” is the best of the trilogy and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, especially Tolkien fans.\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 58 minutes and was shot in New Zealand.\nGRADE: B/B- (6.5/10)'], ['80%', ""Overall, I give this four stars.  Not five, because some of the changes really bug me, as a long-time Tolkien fan, but a solid four.\nThe casting, to start, was brilliant.  Sean Astin was the absolute perfect choice for Sam, and did a remarkable job bringing that character to life for us.  He really WAS Sam, in this role, in a very deep way.  I always liked his acting, but here, he showed how talented he actually is.  Just amazing.  Elijah Wood gives a great performance of Frodo, and those expressive eyes of his really add a lot of depth to the emotions the character goes through, which are such an important part of the story.  Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan both did great work, for our other two main hobbits.  Their smiles, their singing; just every aspect of these characters was so real.  Viggo Mortensen, of course, was excellent.  He's always good, and though I never would have pictures him as Aragorn, he delivered everything we could hope for.  Great choice for that role!  John Rhys-Davies, as expected, gave us the Gimli we wanted.  Phenomenal actor, and I can't imagine anyone doing that role better.  Orlando Bloom plays a convincing Legolas, and handles the nuances of being an elf quite well.  Sean Bean as Boromir was outstanding, bringing the strength of that character to life, and making us love him.  Then we have Ian McKellen, as Gandalf.  I could never have chosen someone for that role, but the casting folks hit a home run with this one.  Everything about his character was just right.  Literally everything.  I can't read the books without seeing these people in these roles now.  The rest of the cast ws good as well.\nThen we have the setting.  New Zealand has to have some of the most utterly gorgeous scenery on the planet.  Seeing it in these movies was great, and convincingly Middle Earth, and seeing more since, in other videos, just WOW!  Thanks, to the people of New Zealand, for allowing this to be filmed there!\nThe sets were just fantastic.  Everything looked as good as I'd always hoped it would look, with all the charm, mystery, and wonder  Tolkien fan could hope for.  From Bag end to Rivendell to the vastness of \nMiddle Earth, everything we saw was just right.\nThe only issues I had were some of the changes.  Yes, I know things don't always work in movies as they do in books, but when whole sections are just omitted, that bothers me.  It's not like the movies weren't long already!  That omitted section, with which Tolkien fans will be quite familiar, was a very important part of the plot!  I also didn't care for some of the other changes, and the way Arwen was used, the scene at the river being one example.\nAll in all, though, this was a well done movie, and even though some things bug me, this film, and the rest of the series, will be viewed many times.

Don’t get me wrong, I like this movie and have watched it a few times over the years, but I have watched  (or read, for that matter) very little else in the fantasy  genre. I didn’t get too far into the Game of Thrones as the violent rapes got old for me fast.\nSo I watched this first entry of the Lord of the Rings trilogy as just a viewer, not a fan, and I liked it just fine. The complex plot held together well and the scenery was gorgeous. There was violence, but not gore, and for those who don’t like war movies, there wasn’t as much of it here as there is in the other two films of the trilogy.\nI gather the elfin roles for women were enlarged and brought to the fore, and why not; women were mostly good for setting mead and large pieces of rare meat down on tables in front of their warrior men.\nI must confess, I found it jarring that the warriors like Strider were so invincible, walking into a horde of sixty orcs and scattering them like toy soldiers with his sword. I know they are epic heroes, but if I’m an orc, I stand back and throw something or whatever, but it is similar to the old legends with semi-gods like Achilles, back when Hector was a pup.\nI am not going to compare the film to the book — I read it decades ago when I was in high school. It is worth watching and though real fans will take this with a large grain of salt, I think it is possibly the definitive adaptation of the book.

Music can play a huge part in how much I enjoy a film, so I'm delighted to say that the score is here is fantastic. That is by no means the only positive, obviously.\nThe cast are excellent. Elijah Wood gives a strong performance in the lead role. I've seen Wood in others things down the years and have actually found him a bit hit-and-miss, but here he is very good. Elsewhere, I really enjoyed watching Viggo Mortensen's character.\nAway from those two, there are a whole host of noteworthy cast members. Orlando Bloom, or Will Turner to me, is involved, as are the likes of Ian McKellen and Sean Bean. I also liked Liv Tyler in her role.\nThe look of the film is spectacular, and has aged extremely well even to this day.

This is the first of three segments called ""The Lord of the Rings"". The parts left out are parts best left out. Tom Bombadil, for example, along with his wife, represents a very Hitler like Aryan ideology of supremacy that Tolkien often engaged in. \nThe film begins with a narrative and action sequence that is awesome, and then goes into the ""status quo"" setting of the ""shire"" of hobbits, much like the status quo setting of films like ""Women of Dolwyn"".\nFrom there, we get an amazing story of four hobbits who embark on a journey of utmost importance, joined by a wizard, an elf, a dwarf, and two men.\nThe direction is stunning.

This is a masterpiece.'], ['80%', 'So now that the picture houses across the UK are beginning to reopen, this is the third film I\'ve settled down to watch in front of a huge big screen - and it\'s a belter. You can only wonder at the sheer imagination of JRR Tolkien and of Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh & Philippa Boyens as they adeptly adapt this epic tale of power for a new generation. Certainly, it over-hams the accents - maybe just a few too many ""rrrs"" in ""Arrragorrrrn"" but otherwise it\'s a feast for senses. When the hairy-footed Hobbit ""Bilbo"" (Sir Ian Holm) gets to eleventy-one he sets off to write his life-story with the elves. He leaves his possessions - including a mysterious ring - to Frodo (Elijah Wood). When visiting wizard ""Gandalf"" (Sir Ian McKellen) identifies it as the epitome of wickedness that puts all of their lives are in danger, ""Frodo"" and his lifelong friend ""Sam"" (Sean Astin) must flee their bucolic happiness. This first instalment of the trilogy tracks the journey of the hobbits as they meet ""Stryder"" (Viggo Mortensen) and together try to evade the pursuing wraith attempting to get to ""Elrond"" the Elvish king in ""Rivendell"" and decide what is best to do with this evil, seemingly indestructible talisman. Their only solution proves to be returning the ring to the lava-filled cavern of ""Mount Doom"" where it was forged: only there can it\'s corruption be defeated. The brave hobbits, together with two men, an elf and a dwarf set out to accomplish this all but impossible task fighting the weather, evil orcs, malevolent magic and the harsh terrain on their treacherous way. It\'s the ultimate fantasy adventure; that sticks to the spirit, if not to every word, of the original work. The effects both in make-up and from the computer are expertly applied creating a real sense of tension and peril that compliments, rather than subsumes, the actual action and beautiful cinematography of the New Zealand scenery through which our intrepid gang must travel. This is probably the weakest of the three episodes as it takes a good hour to get going; but once it does and the ""Fellowship"" takes firmer form with a superb John Howard-Davies; a handsome Orlando Bloom and even the usually wooden Sean Bean raises his game to give us as a truly cracking, at times quite scary adventure that is magnificently scored by the inspired Howard Shore. This is not really a film that works on the telly - however large the screen may be. To do justice to the creativity of all concerned it just has to be given the respect it deserves and be seen in the cinema. If you get a chance, you should go see it (again!).']]"

Order goes thusly;\nI had the privilege of going to Sydney and watching this almost a full three weeks before it’s American release, in a special advance screening for fans and a handful of critics. I drove up and back on a day trip with my mate HRV, spent over $400 between us… So worth it.\nI think perhaps my expectations of The Avengers were too high. In fact I know they were, even so, I feel that it almost managed to meet them. All but two of the fears I had about this epic were quashed without a doubt. I initially was worried about Mark Ruffalo helming the role of The Hulk/Bruce Banner after taking over from Edward Norton who was ousted after his first appearance. My complaints were completely unfounded however, as Mark Ruffalo presents us with an at least as good Marvel Hero.\nIn terms of entertainment, The Avengers is one of the greatest feats ever produced. At the screening I went to, I actually missed more than a couple of lines due to the fact that the entire bloody cinema was in hysterics from some classic Joss Whedon (Director - Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Dollhouse) humour. The squabbles between these larger than life characters are not quite up to the peak that Jon Favreau’s Iron Man & Iron Man 2 sit on, but in terms of film in general, they are some of the better interactions I’ve ever seen.\nThe only weak points I really have to whinge about are both quite minor, and perhaps can be rectified in the MCU future. Firstly, Thor’s return to Earth (whilst brilliantly dramatic and pretty) was quite weak in terms of exposition. That said, this isn’t a Thor movie, so we don’t need to know everything that happens to him. Also, in next year’s Thor 2, it is very possible we’ll discover more specific details about the first few scenes of his return. Secondly, Loki’s army also came across to me quite weakly. In case we have any Marvel aficionados in the crowd, I won’t spoil it by telling you who they’re supposed to be, but in general the whole army was essentially a meat shield used to bump out scenes in which The Avengers get to kick ass. A very enjoyable part of the film, but one that doesn’t really drive the story at all.\nI feel the only way I can adequately describe just how much you need to see this movie (in cinemas) is this: For those of you who understand me, you will be know and be aware of just how much I fucking hate the concept of Blu-Ray. I am going to buy a Blu-Ray player, a HD television, and Blu-Ray discs, just so that I will get more special features when The Avengers is released. Never have I even considered doing such a thing before.\nThe Avengers doesn’t get into your mind and rape it in the best way possible like Revolver or Donnie Darko. It doesn’t get into your guts and turn them with nostalgic violence like the brilliance in Doomsday or Outpost. It gets into your heart, and leaves you not just wanting, but needing more.

I did wonder how they where going to get the Hulk in there since he’s supposed to be uncontrollable but they did it. Okay they downplayed his uncontrollability a bit but I can live with that. I absolutely loved the “puny god” scene (if you haven’t seen the film yet you’ll have to see it to know what I mean, I wont spoil it in advance).\nI have to say that I found Thor himself a bit underwhelming again though.

I love movies and as I enter the later stages of my forties I'm pleased to say I have a wide range of film genre interests. I have very much enjoyed The Avengers solo films so far, with the exception of Iron Man 2 which quite frankly is average at best, but the reality is that if The Avengers failed as a movie, that Whedon got it so wrong, then I wouldn't be foaming at the mouth or proclaiming that the director be stripped naked and whipped around the streets of Hollywood!

It looks fabulous on Blu-ray, the art design, the colour photography and Silvestri's score rumbles like thunder and crackles like lightning, just as a super hero movie score should do. The cast performances are hugely enjoyable as they bounce off of one and other, feeding off the respective thespian energy with a knowing of the right tone to make this colourful comic book world be all that it can be.

Jackson's Nick Fury could have done with more screen time and Cobie Smulders is sadly short changed as well. The Chitauri are only really a threat because of their sheer numbers, not because of any great alien design, and, well, The Hulk CGI hasn't really advanced much from the 2008 version, but really these are small itches rather than big ones.

It will be seen as such for many fans of the source(s) who have waited with baited breath for this coming together of their heroes, and that notion really shouldn't irk the more highbrow film fans out there. Me? No it isn't the best film of 2012, but as I found my self perched on the edge of my seat as the finale unfurls in a wave of explosive heroic energy, and I caressed my ribs from laughing out loud, I knew then that undoubtedly The Avengers is the most fun film of 2012. 9/10""], ['-', ""Definitely the greatest superhero movie of all time.

Halle Bailey is VERY impressive and the cast accompanies her excellently.\nHowever, it\'s not without its problems: the new songs are, for the most part, forgettable; the visuals are better than anticipated, but the feeling of being surrounded by fake walls never quite disappears; and Ursula was left with unexplored potential.\nThat said, it\'s one of Disney\'s best live-action remakes of recent times and deserves to be seen by every child in the world in need of some inspiration - as we once were.""\nRating: B+'], ['60%', 'When they get the notion to remake an animated classic into a live action film, Disney is a well-oiled machine. They’ve found varying degrees of success and failure (“The Lion King,” “Cinderella,” “Pinocchio”) along the way, and their latest cartoon-to-real-life adventure “The Little Mermaid” lands somewhere on the better-than-average scale. There are things that work (a scene-stealing Melissa McCarthy as Ursula the Sea Witch), things that don’t (a painfully lengthy run time), and things I never want to see again (the truly dreadful “Under the Sea” number), but the film’s reimagined storytelling delivers just enough magic to weather the storm overall.\nThe film tells the classic story of Ariel (Halle Bailey), a curious and spirited young mermaid who yearns for adventure on land. Ariel is the youngest of King Triton’s (Javier Bardem) daughters, and also the most defiant. She spends her days exploring shipwrecks and avoiding dangerous sharks (and humans) with her crustacean pal Sebastian (voice of Daveed Diggs) and her loyal fish friend, Flounder (voice of Jacob Tremblay). On her quest to find out more about the world beyond the sea, Ariel makes a deal with evil sea witch Ursula (Melissa McCarthy) to cast a spell and give her human legs in exchange for her voice. She must find true love’s kiss from the dashing Prince Eric (Jonah Hauer-King) within a few days or the consequences will be dire.\nThe film sticks to the original story, and the fairytale seems outdated. The idea of marrying a handsome prince in a few days is icky, even if it is a fantasy film. It’s interesting how much of the action feels a lot more dire in a live action setting versus in an animated film, with scary eels getting blown to bits and a shipwreck that’s set ablaze as sailors swim for their lives. The worst part of the cartoon to live action translation has to be Sebastian and Flounder, however. It’s startling to see Ariel’s buddies look like a realistic talking fish and crab, and it’s one of the most jarring and unpleasant things about the movie. It takes a lot of willpower to go with the flow, if you can get over the initial shock.\nThe cinematography is dark and drab (although it does look as if it’s really filmed underwater), and Rob Marshall‘s direction is barely adequate. The film is choppy, slow, and long, and its biggest failure is the uneven pacing. Some of the better parts of the story are hurried along in favor of what should be show-stopping action, but the film is so dark that it’s hard to tell what’s going on in what should be the most exciting moments. Why rush the more compelling elements of the narrative in favor for a poorly executed final battle between Ursula and our heroine? It really strips away a lot of the undersea magic.\nThe cast helps keep things afloat, and the performances are all solid. McCarthy is the standout with her robust turn as one of Disney’s greatest screen villains, and Diggs breathes a fresh, new life into loyal crab Sebastian. Casting Awkwafina as the voice of know-it-all seagull Scuttle is inspired, and she creates an updated version of the character that’s the perfect fit for the film. Perhaps the greatest strength comes from the irresistible chemistry between Hauer-King and Bailey, two actors who comfortably step into their lead roles with plenty of charm. She makes a great Ariel, finding a terrific balance of innocence, curiosity, and stubbornness, and he is the perfect non-threatening Prince Charming that is the stuff of many young girls’ dreams.\nThe biggest thing the film does right is keeping the original arrangements of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman’s most beloved songs (the updated verses, which removed some problematic and antiquated lyrics, are done well and hardly noticeable). Cherished ballads like “Part of Your World” and “Kiss the Girl” have a stirring emotional power that immediately helps audience form a strong connection with the material, even if the movie is just so/so. The soundtrack probably makes the movie seem a lot better than it actually is. The new tunes, including a kid-friendly number called “The Scuttlebutt” (featuring lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda), sound too contemporary to really fit in, but they’re fun and bring a bit of spirited pep when the film becomes draggy.\n“The Little Mermaid” isn’t a great movie, but it’s one of the better Disney live action remakes because it stays true to the source material. There’s just enough magic, adventure, and romance to make this a satisfying experience for the whole family.']]"

Damien Anderson (expertly played by Jonathan Majors) is a very sympathetic antagonist that has a direct connection with Adonis Creed’s past. This connection is at the forefront of the conflict as Creed tries to reconcile with his past mistakes while also being true to his present self. This back and forth is excellently done and evolves Creed further as a boxer and a man. I really enjoyed this story overall, and while it may not be the most unique script to hit the silver screen, it does enough to differentiate itself from the rest of the Rocky universe, and I can respect that.\nThe acting in this film is excellent, as it has been in previous Creed films. I thought that there might be a hole left by the absence of Sylvester Stallone, but I really did not notice it at all. Michael B. Jordan is able to get the best out of the entire cast, and everyone is better than ever. Tessa Thompson is fantastic; her chemistry with Jordan is incredible. The addition of their daughter creates a very wholesome family dynamic. Jonathan Majors is superb; he is intimidating, tragic, and full of emotion that the audience can genuinely resonate with. His anger is justified, and his portrayal of this angry kid who had his life taken from him is incredibly genuine. He was one of the best parts of the film.\nWith Michael B. Jordan behind the camera, this film has the most unique cinematography in the entire series. Jordan takes some liberties with the material that came before to deliver a modern spin on the boxing genre. Where previous films tried to have a broadcast experience grounded in grit and realism, Creed III turns that on its head, delivering the most stunning action scenes I have ever seen. The anime inspiration is apparent, with slow motion used sparingly but effectively. The finale fight has some very creative choices that create an intimate connection between our two leads that is a great backdrop to not only the fight but the story as a whole.\nOverall, I had an excellent time watching Creed III.

He (""Damian"") is now determined to succeed in the ring and so his friend tries to sort it all out - only to discover that this lean, mean, fighting machine has an altogether different agenda and that is going to force the former champ to prove whether or not he still has what it takes. The story is an hybrid of too many others and plays out as predictably as the sun coming up. Add to the mix a degree of familial discord and melodrama and we are left with something largely forgettable that I found to be a pretty poor relation of the previous, much more charismatic and grittier efforts in this franchise. The actual boxing scenes are impressively photographed but there\'s just no jeopardy - and I\'d largely given up. Pretty to look at, yes - but not a great watch.'], ['70%', 'When it comes to boxing movies, it can sometimes feel like there are few stories left to be told. What works so well about “Creed III” is that instead of being a laser-focused sports story, co-writers Keenan Coogler and Zach Baylin‘s script leans heavily into a sincere family drama. It’s also a solid directorial debut from actor Michael B. Jordan, who reprises his role as the title character.\nAdonis Creed (Jordan) has retired from sparring in the ring. After amassing dozens of titles, he’s now a devoted husband to Bianca (Tessa Thompson) and father to Amara (Mila Davis-Kent), a loving son to Mary-Ann (Phylicia Rashad), and runs a successful boxing gym where he works with the latest and greatest talent in the sport. Things are going well until his former childhood friend Damian (Jonathan Majors) resurfaces after nearly two decades in prison, and a long-buried incident (which is eventually revealed) causes tension between them. Eager to prove himself and get the boxing career he always wanted, Damian asks Adonis if he can help get him a shot in a fight. Feeling guilty, he agrees. Damian is a skilled but dirty fighter, which creates even more problems. Things go from bad to worse, with an eventual title fight between the two men.\nThe fight scenes are well directed and exciting, even if they are predictable. The film expects the audience to know the general rules of boxing so if you have no idea what’s an illegal or legal hit, you may be in over your head. (I have next to zero knowledge of the sport but I still enjoyed the fight scenes).\nThe film’s strongest element is the robust character development, which has always been a huge part of the franchise. Learning the painful history between Adonis and Damian makes their narrative of friends turned adversaries even more compelling, and there are genuinely touching moments featuring Bianca, Amara, and Mary-Ann. The chemistry and talent of the cast are both terrific.\nThat being said, there is a lot of story here. A lot. It makes much of the film feel too hurried as Jordan rushes through scene after scene. It’s good that the movie isn’t draggy, but this is a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it type of project. And although the characters and their relationships are detailed, parts of the script feel hollow and of course, predictable.\nFor the third film in a franchise, “Creed III” is far better than reasonably expected.

I still find it uncomfortable to watch the actuality of the wreck, which features occasionally throughout the film - I feel like I am quite literally walking through someone\'s grave; but it does lend a potent hook upon which this lengthy, but well thought out and constructed drama is presented. Criticisms have been made of it\'s factual inaccuracies, and it may well play a bit fast and loose with some of the real characterisations - but it\'s a drama, and to be enjoyed has to be appreciated in that sphere.

I understand that it was implemented for the main story to have a more emotional impact, but it was not needed.

Having said that I think the funny idea of going through earth’s core in a tunnel through the planet is way more far-fetched than actually going to Mars and, although the gravity reversal was a good idea in itself, the instant on/off effect was just ridiculous. Obviously no scientific experts where hired for this movie.\nThe 1990 version had a lot of action in it and this one doesn’t disappoint in that area. Actually, the entire film is pretty much one long action chase and a pretty well done at that. One gripe I have though is that I felt that Quaid was a bit on the wimpy side. But then, that probably comes from comparing with the Schwarzenegger “original”.\nSo the bottom line is that I quite liked it, It’s a good solid action movie, but it didn’t de-throne the 1990 version.'], ['80%', 'Overall : A fantastic sci-fi action film that is much better than its reviews imply.\nWhile based on the original Total Recall starring Arnold Schwarzenegger film from 1990, Total Recall (2012) differs in many ways. The tone is more serious and less zany than the first. The setting is on Earth rather than Mars, and the ending is left a little less ambiguous than the first. These differences caused mixed reviews, mostly from fans of the original. However, I enjoyed this film much more than the original! The acting and effects were much improved, and the action sequences were amazingly well done. Total Recall (2012) is more straightforward of a sci-fi action movie than its predecessor, but I find that a strength rather than a fault.'], ['100%', ""Totally class. Totally absorbing.

Eddie meanwhile wants a more conservative approach feeding Venom chicken and chocolate as he knows the eyes of the authorities are still upon him and he has to convince the world that Venom is dead and no longer a threat.\nAt the same time; serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) has selected Eddie to interview him in San Quentin and the two form an unusual connection as Cletus cryptically speaks to Eddie which underlines a deeper motivation.\nWith the help of Venom; Eddie is able to decipher clues found on the walls of Cletus’s cell which leads authorities to several of his victims. This results in a rapid rise in status for Eddie and fast tracks Cletus for execution as his main means of leverage is now gone.\nThis leads to a rift where Eddie and Venom split and each has to struggle to adjust to life without one another.\nAt this point, the film has mainly been odd bits of whimsy between Venom and Eddie around the establishment of the plot and threat. However, things go into chaos mode when Cletus becomes infected with a Symbiote and turns into a destruction spewing death machine known as “Carnage”.\nCletus and Carnage both have their own agendas and Cletus uses Carnage to exact his revenge as well as locate a figure from his past that is as big a danger as he is.\nAs any fan of films of this genre knows; this scenario leads to a showdown between the central characters which are awash in abundant CGI, loud noises, and destruction. While this is not a bad thing and certainly one of the main reasons I enjoy films of this type; the film never seemed to fully click for me and as such was not as good as I thought it could have been.\nIn many ways, the film reminded me of how comic-based films were done before Marvel started their own studios and their phenomenal run of hits based on their work.\nThere have been multiple attempts to adapt comics into films over the last few decades and many of them have not lived up to expectations or failed outright. One of the biggest reasons is in my opinion is that those behind the projects were hindered by the studio, wanted to put their own spin on the material and strayed from the source; or failed to show the attributes that made the characters so appealing to fans.\nWhat we often get is action sequences and CGI galore but without stories or characters that fully draw in the audience and fail to capture the essence of the comics.\nDirector Andy Serkis has done a great job with the visuals of the film but the tone seems off. The early part of the film is filled with comedic moments that are either hit or miss. Some of which was almost to the point where I wondered if it was supposed to be a parody.\nThe plot is fairly linear with nothing unexpected as it is simply bad guys get loose; bad guys cause death and destruction, can the heroes stop them. The climactic scene lacks any “wow” moments for me as it was mainly CGI characters rapidly moving around causing damage to one another and their environment. There was no real tension for me and the ultimate resolution seemed a bit anti-climactic.\nFor me the best moment of the film was a mid-credits scene that really popped as it sets up all sorts of interesting options and indicates that Venom may be about to graduate to bigger and better things.\nFor now; the cast is solid as is the CGI; I just wish the story was more engaging as it had the potential to be so much more.\n3 stars out of 5'], ['70%', 'Let There be Carnage!\nIt is a not bad movie to watch.

The value of friendships is a more than common theme in cinema, but perhaps this is one of the most paradigmatic and memorable films when the subject is precisely that.\nVery consistently based on a book by Stephen King, the plot is simple: four young friends get together to find the corpse of a boy who disappeared, and set off on a long journey on foot that will take them through a series of obstacles and difficulties, and that will test the friendship and unity of the group. The matter itself ends up being quite irrelevant, no one cares about the dead boy. What matters is the journey of the four boys and the way they overcome difficulties, forgetting their differences and what eventually separates them. Each of them has their own sad story: broken homes, families with little structure, domestic violence, dramatic family losses (a father, an older brother…). In short, none of them is a boy born with a silver spoon or into a well-positioned family. And the film explores this very well, with inspired dialogue and absolutely believable and well-conceived situations.\nRob Reiner is a very effective director who knows very well what he wants. One of the points in which he shined most was in choosing the filming locations, designing the sets and reconstituting the period (the film takes place in the late 1950s, at the height of the post-war “American dream”): the director It really manages to transport us to the past and to magnificently designed and credible places. Another point he valued was the choice of actors for the four main characters. In addition to being a perfect fit in terms of age and physique, Corey Feldman, Jerry O’Connell, River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton are very talented and do their best with their characters and their material. Without the effort of these four young people, the film would not have the strength it has.\nOn a technical level, the film stands out for its good cinematography, the sets, costumes and props that I mentioned above, the choice of period cars and an excellent soundtrack, featuring some iconic melodies of the time.']]"

Don't expect character development either. Don't expect to be shock like you were when you watched The Exorcist. I’ve read several critic reviews were they just don’t get it. They use words to describe it like “using every trick in the horror trope” or “predictable”, “throwing the kitchen sink at”, or “not enough character development”. Well forget what you heard because there is more bite to this movie than you’d expect.\nOkay, so we begin with a spooky opening sequence where two nuns are fighting to save humanity from a malevolent presence that is about to enter our world. One is dragged into a room and the other commits suicide by hanging. Suicide is a sin, right? Makes you wonder what type of evil is powerful enough to destroy Catholic nuns?\nBeing the beginning of The Conjuring movie universe, this story begins like this, Father Burke (Demién Bichir) is summoned by the Vatican to investigate the suicide of a nun at The Abbey, a castle located somewhere in Romania. Apparently Father Burke has a trauma and a shameful past after having failed to save a teen from an exorcism he performed. Makes you wonder why The Vatican would send a priest like Father Burke on such a dangerous mission. The Vatican doesn’t send Father Burke alone on this task though. They assign Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), who hasn’t yet taken her vows. A nun that hasn't taken her vows yet, and not your typical nun either. She's contrary to the average nun. She seems so innocent.\nFather Burke and Sister Irene are taken to The Abbey by a local delivery man, Frechie (Jonas Bloquet). (You may remember Frenchie as the first exorcism performed by The Warrens from the original The Conjuring. Lorraine Warren has the painting of The Nun at their home and references it in the film.) Sister Irene was chosen to go on this assignment because she experiences visions, these visions provide the information needed to uncover what actually occurred at The Abbey.\nThe Abbey has been the site of a malevolent force locked away for centuries. The Church took over The Abbey and placed a congregation of nuns to pray 12 hours a day to keep the evil force in control. However, after WW2 bombing weaken the structure of The Abbey, the evil locked inside of it found another way to escape, and using the guise of a nun, slowly grows in strength causing terror on those around it.\nYes, The Nun is a supernatural survival horror installment of The Conjuring universe. You don’t have to be a die hard fan of the horror genre in order to be scared. Yes, there is a lot of the same tropes from the most popular supernatural horror movies and that is because this is how demonic infestation happens. \nDirector Corin Hardy and screenplay writer Gary Dauberman do wonderfully.\nWhat this film gives us is tricky camera and visual effects that showcase how the demon works. We find out that the demon’s name is Valak–an ancient demon from Hell that was summoned by the count performed sacrificial rituals. \nIf you are expecting character development then you’re not going to find it here. This story doesn’t need a lot of characters at all. You don’t need a lot of information about these characters because Valak is the only character this story is about.. One minute he’s behind the character’s back, the next his shadow appears on the wall, he reanimates dead corpses and even manifesting animals and the usual superhuman strength as well as taking on human form. He ghosts the characters as well. It’s always interesting to see how the director and screenwriter pull off these visual effects.\nFather Burke character plays like a detective searching the castle for any information he can use to exorcise the demonic spirit from the world while Sister Irene uses her visions to lead her to the truth about what occurred at The Abbey as well as discover anything that she can use to send the evil spirit back to Hell. If you like Ash from the Evil Dead horror series, then you’ll like Frenchie because he is the outsider in all of this providing necessary dark humor. Frenchie isn’t afraid to use a shotgun to blow off the heads of a couple of deadites disguised as nuns.\nWhat also makes this film enjoyable to watch with a group, is the pacing. There are enough slow moments for you to make jokes about the characters or the visual bombarding your senses.\nI give this film an enthusiastic 7/10 for its creepy mood and intense disturbing images. And those squeamish people, no worries. There isn't a lot of gore.\nDefinitely a great popcorn horror flick to watch in the dark with your friends. Definitely worth the movie ticket.

You would think that with so many ""Mummy"" films of the past already on the market this new lease of life would be giving us, well, something new to gorge on, but what we actually get is a painfully familiar.\nFrom a summer blockbuster audience pleaser point of view it has the requisite effects work, it\'s loud, rambunctious and has Cruise and Crowe for star wattage, but Cruise is going through the motions, Crowe is laughably miscast (with a later dreadful accent issue to compound the misery), while the rest of the cast play second fiddle to the over egged effects work.\nIt\'s neither dark enough as a head bothering thinker or witty enough to tickle the funny bone, in fact it at times is very dull. There\'s also the worrying attempts at crossing over into further creature feature ventures, a big reveal for a main character is sloppily handled, whilst the finale lands as flat as a pancake.\nThere\'s some nice touches, the ""Mummy"" design is sharp (love those eyes), a plane crash is exhilarating and the film\'s stand out sequence, and the tomb/prison design is neat, but after that you start to scratch around for positives, which in itself tells a story. At least it looks and sounds great in HD, the colours and sub-woofer shakes a treat for the senses.\nIt\'s all well and good people asking for it not to be judged by other Mummy films, but the creators here make that inevitable. Lifting the plot from one of the 1940\'s films, and even stealing a scene from the Stephen Sommers school of Mummy film making. It\'s unoriginal and as an opening salvo for a franchise it leaves Universal with a hell of a lot of work to do to make it work. 5/10'], ['60%', 'In view of the reviews this movie has received I was not expecting much.

Sure, it is not a great movie but it is not really bad either.\nIt is not just a remake of the original The Mummy movies which I think is actually good. That concept is becoming a bit deja vue after all.\nTo me the worst part of the movie was Tom Cruise. Total lack of charisma. He really do not succeed in his role. He is mostly wondering about being meh and just reacts to the various situations he is thrown into.\nRussell Crowe is a lot better as Doctor Jekyll.

In general I think it was reasonably well done. The special effects were enjoyable and the mummy herself, Sofia Boutella, was not bad at all.\nOn the whole the movie and the story held a lot of promise but in the end the overall performance failed to really impress. There were plenty of good things but they were just not put to good work. I think the movie would have fared a lot better with a more charismatic lead in it and perhaps a bit better script for him.\nBottom line, I did enjoy the movie.

While “The Mummy” garnered $410 million worldwide, it was considered a disappointment and critics generally lambasted it.\nI found the modern setting a nice change of environment compared to the late 1920s-40s of the previous trilogy; it prevented it from being the same-old-same-old. I also didn\'t mind the various locations outside of ancient Egypt, e.g. northern Iraq and England; even Hammer\'s version from 1959 started in Egypt, but quickly moved to England. I also favored the switch to a female mummy and that the slightly convoluted story kept you guessing.

The link between Cruise and Johnson becomes tiresome, as does all the comedy in the film in truth - there's a few chuckles, but nothing laugh worthy. The zombie vibe doesn't fit, either.\nWhat also doesn't help is the fact they're blatantly trying to set up a film universe of some sort, which they put too much focus on. I found the effects hit-and-miss, I feel like they could've used more practical stuff rather than relying so much on CGI - for the make-up et al. at least.\nCruise leads ably and does a decent enough job - he has done far greater of course.

The one that plays while the train is leaving London. (I found out it\'s actually about halfway into the track ""Evacuating London."")

Some pithy dialogue and a rousing (if slightly repetitive) score from Klaus Badelt take us criss-crossing the Caribbean constantly jumping from frying pan to fire. The star for me here is certainly Geoffrey Rush. A man who rarely disappoints, and on this occasion brings a comically potent degree of menace as his ""Barbossa"" character ensures that the plot thickens and the story gathers momentum. It\'s a bit on the long side - there are a few sagging moments now and again, but a solid supporting cast led by Kevin McNally provide some borderline slapstick humour, occasionally tempered by the dignified persona of an underused Jonathan Pryce\'s ""Gov.

""God"" tries to control her by suggesting a marriage to ""Max"" but he insists on such a fastidious contract that ""Duncan"" (Mark Ruffalo) concludes she must be worth investigating.

This film is genuinely laugh-out-loud at times, and the performance from Emma Stone has to be her best. She plays the almost porcelain-like and childish ""Bella"" when we meet her expertly, and that skill prevails as her character evolves into a savvy, street-smart and capable woman who quickly learns to fight fire with fire. Ruffalo is also on super form as her travelling companion and Kathryn Hunter also turns in a solid performance as her Parisian paymaster ""Swiney"". The narrative takes us on a fantastic tour of European cities, but also on a wonderfully evocative tour of humanity - warts and all. ""Bella"" has a practical and analytical mind that at times seems ludicrously detached, then somehow she ends up having got it right all along.

The FBI are on soon their trail and skedaddle they must, straight into the arms of the waiting ""Talokan"" who take them to their beautiful watery homeland where we learn just how they evolved. Somewhat narked, the Queen wants her daughter back and that action sows the seeds for a conflict between the two nations that, well, you can guess the rest. Sadly, that\'s the problem here. Despite a really strong and vibrant performance from Wright and some very fine production values, there is precious little story here. It is far, far, too long to sustain the thin plot and the conflict engineered between the two races is flawed in more ways than an US Congressional election. The pace is really slow, the combat scenes could have been choreographed by Sir Matthew Bourne - or by a Wakandan cheerleader at their equivalent of the ""Superbowl"" - and the supporting characters aren\'t on screen long enough to give Miss Wright enough help to wade through the frequent tedium. I wasn\'t helped by Huerta\'s very thick accent which made his dialogue nigh-on impossible to comprehend at times and the denouement screamed sequel so loudly that I forgot that I\'d long given up on any jeopardy at the end two hours ago. There is a bit of character tragedy, character loyalty and thankfully Martin Freeman\'s (""Ross"" - why does he need an American accent?) appears but sparingly as we go along but Marvel must stop taking the audience for granted. They have to realise that their gorgeous Avatar-esque visual effects and technical wizardry are not going to entertain us indefinitely if the stories continue to deliver so weakly.

There are so many side plots and new characters being introduced that the film has a hard time finding its footing. For as much as I enjoyed Riri Williams and here banter with Wakadans, her arch was not necessary. By omitting this character, the story could have been more focused and streamlined creating an easier viewing experience and deflating the runtime.\nThe writing was decent, but it was pretty exposition heavy. There were countless number of lines that were strictly feeding information to the audience, and they felt inorganic and awkward in the moment. These writing mishaps really hurt my enjoyment and constantly pulled me out of the film.\nAfter those main criticisms, I think this movie overall does a great job in all other departments. The action is surprisingly light, but when it does come it is intense and well-choreographed. There are some really unique fight sequences and weapons introduced with the ""Atlanteans"" that allowed for some really cool scenes and visuals that were done with some stellar CGI. I specifically like how the final battle had some letterboxing that was not present in the rest of the film. It gave it a grand scale that I thought was excellent touch.\nThe performances were fantastic all around. Angela Bassett was mesmerizing and really captivated me with her emotion and distress with the passing of her son. There is a scene in here that gave me literal goosebumps. Dominique Thorne was a great addition as Iron-Heart and Lupita Nyong\'o was amazing in her limited screen time. I loved Winston Duke and desperately wanted more screentime from him. He was sidelined for the majority of the film, and I think that was the wrong decision. Letitia Wright is the real highlight here. She stepped into a very difficult situation and acted her ass off. I never envisioned her as a lead actress, but she proved me wrong.\nSomething I want to note that I do not normally include in my reviews in the music choice. The score to this movie was crafted brilliantly and really elevate so many scenes.

There are some Indiana Jones elements in the Malta segment and James Bond bits at the technologically advanced lair in the mountains, both of which I appreciate.\nYet I strangely never bought the characters as real people. They always struck me as actors performing according to a contrived script, which tries too hard to check the diversity boxes.

The dinosaurs are present but not the main focus, giving the impression that they are only there to extend the franchise. Even the inclusion of Alan Grant seems to be more for nostalgic purposes than contributing to the story. Chris Pratt\'s character also appears to be underutilized and serves more as a prop rather than a leading character.\nThe camera work in the movie is particularly shoddy, with cuts from one angle to another creating confusion, especially in fast-paced scenes like the one in Malta. The depiction of Malta in the movie is also disappointing, with the country portrayed as a dirty, third-world Arabic nation covered in desert sand, which is not an accurate representation of the country. The use of Arabic style music in the background also seems out of place and unnecessary.\nOverall, Jurassic World Dominion seems to be a movie that was made to extend the franchise rather than being a well-planned and executed story. It is disappointing that a franchise that should have stopped by the third installment continues to churn out mediocre movies. Although the movie is not a complete disaster, it falls short of being an enjoyable watch.\nAdditionally, the length of the movie seems to be excessive, and the dragging plot does not help in holding the audience\'s attention. The story\'s predictability adds to the monotony, leaving little to surprise or engage the viewers.\nAs if to acknowledge the franchise\'s overreliance on gimmicks and sequels, Ian Malcolm\'s line, ""Jurassic World? Not a fan,"" serves as a meta-commentary on the movie itself. It is a nod to the fans who have been disappointed by the franchise\'s recent offerings, and unfortunately, Jurassic World Dominion does little to change that sentiment. 5/10']]"

It\'s not much… but the truth is that they are three films that I really liked, and about which I have a very good opinion. This film is very good, fitting into a style that we can call “neo-noir”, insofar as its visual aesthetic is heavily inspired by noir, with the caveats that are due, as it is a color film and not black and white. Polanski is an attentive and meticulous director, who provides the audience with quality work, in which every detail has been thought of.\nWith a story set in San Francisco during the 1930s, the film is very similar to the gangster movies that came out in the 40\'s and 50\'s. The story revolves around a private detective, an ex-cop, who is hired to watch a man in what appears to be just another case of adultery. Everything changes when he discovers that the woman who hired him is not a jealous wife. The search for answers will lead him to a web of intrigue and crimes that involves an important Californian company and a public works contract that can be decisive for the city\'s water storage. It\'s an excellent story, capable of holding us in the first few minutes and that harmoniously combines tension, romance and suspense, in the right measures.\nIn addition to an excellent story, with a very well written script, the film presents us with a high quality cast headed by Jack Nicholson, at a time when he was still young and elegant enough to play heartthrob roles. The actor is very good and leaves in this film one of the most interesting works of his career. Faye Dunaway is not far behind and is simply wonderful, dignified and elegantly seductive, as a “femme fatale” should be. John Huston (Nicholson\'s father-in-law in real life, at this time) also appears in the film and makes a very positive and interesting participation.\nIn addition to these qualities, the film also has superb production values: impeccably shot, with great angles and sharpness, it has very good cinematography, beautiful colors and light and shadow effects, in addition to excellent sepia tones that are called reinforcing the dominant ""vintage"" ambience. The film was a very detailed production, in which special attention was given to the creation of the sets and the choice of filming locations, so that everything fit well into the historical period. The choice of cars (which are important in the course of the plot) and the design of the costumes and props was also very careful.

Nicholson is also on super form, his performance is natural and engaging with a solid chemistry between his and Dunaway adding a richness to this rather quirky plot. Roman Polanski has assembled a strong supporting cast - notably John Huston who features sparingly but effectively as her wealthy, untrustworthy, father ""Noah"" and the photography does a great deal to help generate a sense of accumulating intrigue as we gradually make some headway through this complicated and interesting character study. The production looks great - the 1930s costume and motor cars alongside a smattering of the simmering attitudes that prevailed at the time are encapsulated well too. It\'s a shade over two hours, but it hits the ground running and never really stops until the ending that though not entirely unexpected, still has enough elements of surprise to keep it compelling.']]"

In the case of It’s dastardly powder-faced joyboy or shall we say corrosive killjoy Pennywise the Dancing Clown, he definitely takes the cake in terms of his treacherous tendencies to quiet the unsuspecting kiddies in devious fashion. Here is a tip, parents, do not invite the poisonous Pennywise to your kids’ birthday party any time soon to blow up balloons and sing songs. This is just a friendly little warning. There is more to elaborate on regarding the sicko circus funnypants freak later.\nDirector Andy Muschietti (‘Mama’) delves into this surprisingly delicious twisted and terrorizing tale of a killer clown that gets his jollies off snuffing the lives out of rural-based youngsters in this calculating frightfest that pushes all the right buttons of panic and perversion. Skilfully edgy and traumatically tasty, It is a refreshing throwback to old-fashioned gory-minded gems where the boundaries of old-fashioned scare tactics were designed not only by the actual act of homicidal happenings but the mere suggestive nature of the heinous hedonism taking place. Polished and gripping in its shadowy and shifty overtones, It is convincingly probing as an absorbing psychological character study with an off-kilter sense of defiance in its naughty commentary on youthful innocence being compromised.\nBased on the novel from famed hair-raising author Stephen King, It delivers the solid, sordid goods of a wild and wicked imagination following the acidic exploits of a menacing clown in the aforementioned Pennywise (played with penetrating  and devilish aplomb by Bill Skarsgard from ‘Atomic Blonde’) whose murderous methods of slaughtering the young has been a staple signature in his madness for centuries now. The surviving tykes in the quaint town of Derry, Maine must now safeguard themselves from the makeup-wearing whackjob and figure out a way to terminate the baggy-panted beast before he continues to strike again and victimize another doomed child.\nThe backstory behind Pennywise’s existence is that he is some shape-shifting demon that emerges from the sewers only to target the unlucky rugrat in his immediate path while conniving, and conducting his blood-thirsty ways. However, there are a group of children that refuse to play dead for the demented clown and the quest to create an ill-advised showdown with the deplorable Pennywise would prove to be a very violent and mentally scarring experience in the process.\nThe story centres around young Bill (Jaeden Lieberher, ‘Allegiant’) and his early encounter with the sadness of unknowingly witnessing Pennywise’s wrath as it was inferred that the clown had to do with the demise of his precious little brother, George (Jackson Robert Scott), who never returned after enthusiastically wanting to work on a fun project in the basement. This haunting revelation sticks with poor Bill until this very day.\nNowadays, Bill must cope with the typical obstacles at school avoiding bullies and dealing with the pitfalls of peer pressure and needing to belong to a group of trusty associates. Thus, Bill is able to cement close relationships with the town’s other free-spirited youngsters. Still, there is that hovering myth about the mysterious sewers and, yes, the evil-minded Pennywise is at the forefront of fearful concern for Bill and the bunch. In fact, the gang will succumb to their collection of fears, paranoia and hesitation as the suburban legend of the creep-seeking clown clouds each of the kids’ tainted psyches.\nThe ensemble of young actors in It  all register accordingly with their characters’ childhood shock in trying to overcome the overwhelming and petrifying mindset that has invaded their sensibilities. Lieberher has an authentic raw turn as the lead lad invested in the bizarre boundaries of matching wits with the demonic chalk-skinned trickster and his committed craziness. The other supporting cast of exposed kiddies on this adventurous train wreck of terror includes Sophia Lillis (’37’), Finn Wolfhard (from television’s ‘Stranger Things’), Jeremy Ray Taylor (‘Alvin And The Chipmunks: The Road Chip’), Wyatt Oleff (‘Guardians Of The Galaxy”), Chosen Jacobs, Jack Dylan Grazer (‘Tales Of Halloween’) and Nicholas Hamilton (‘Captain Fantastic’).\nThere is no doubt that Skarsgard’s clown of corrosion in Pennywise steals the show with his nefarious nature blistering shamelessly in seedy-minded elation. Clearly, Skarsgard chews the tarnished scenery with his abominable costumed cretin tip toeing on the unassuming sidelines while striking gory goosebump moments for his pubescent prey on screen and the twitchy audience off screen.\nSure, It suffers from the conventional trappings of cheesy false alarm jolts and the obligatory lurking in the dark sequences are arbitrarily tossed in as an aftermath for the legitimate lunacy of our star-making crazed and corruptible clown to perform his showboating insanity. Besides, what horror showcase has not welcomed the invitation of the overused and abused jump-scare techniques highlighted by a jittery soundtrack? Still, Muschietti and screenwriters Chase Palmer, Cary Joji Funkunga and Gary Dauberman manage to supply the infectious and insidious It with well-executed scary shenanigans, well-paced anxiety, wavering vulnerability and decent acting on behalf of the performers that aptly brought to life the eerie visions and vitality of King’s complex, creative mind.\nTruly It is one of the best harrowing and in-depth horror/psychological thrillers to emerge in 2017.

After seeing it, I can say that while it is good, I don't think it's nearly as good as other people are saying it is, and it had the potential to be. Starting off with the good, the film has some fantastic performances from the kids. I think the best performances in the film are from Andy Skaarsgard (or however you spell it) for Pennywise, and the kid who had asthma. I don't know his name, and I haven't seen him in anything before, but he stole the show. The movie also has some pretty scary moments. The scene inside of the house is one of the scariest scenes of the year, and there are lost of images that were genuinely disturbing. While the films was full of cheesy dialogue, the conversations between the kids are extremely entertaining and captivating. When it came to characters, MOST of the characters are well done and fleshed out. And that leads me to one of the 4 things that keep this film from being great in my eyes. Some characters, such as the bullies and Stan, and bland and have no back story. Therefore, whenever they are put in danger, it isn't nearly as scary as with other characters. Another reason I didn't love this film is the rock fight scene. Basically, the Losers Club stumbles upon the bullies and they throw rocks at each other. The rocks seemingly bounce off of their head without any problems like a trampoline. No one gets killed, or even knocked out. Overall, it was a very bad scene. For the most part the special effects were pretty good. However, the leper outside of the creepy house was awful. The costume would be great if it were for a haunted house or prank, but not for a big budgeted horror movie. When it came on screen I literally thought it was a bully playing tricks on him. And the last problem I have with the film is that the police are seemingly nowhere, along with parents. Mild spoilers One of the bullies murders his dad, a police officer, and then around a few scenes later, the son dies too. The bullies like to go around thereatening kids with knives and carving H's into their bellies. I think we would see at least one police officer investegating something in the film, and if not, I think my parents would notice if one day I came home and there was a gigantic blood pool on my shirt.

He manages to combine the more traditional spookiness of the old dark house, with a group of likeable characters who demonstrate the benefits of trust and teamwork as they take on this evil. As with most good horror films, the seemingly invincible must have a weakness, otherwise the plot becomes unsustainable - and this one allows the youngsters to define and exploit this whilst still maintaining enough shock moments and sense of menace to keep the thing interesting. The dialogue isn\'t the best, but that is not so important here - it\'s still a really well paced and genuinely scary story that engenders fear from something so outwardly benign as a clown - normally the symbol of joy and happiness.

Marketing genius or cynical tactics covering a sub-standard film?\nWell ultimately the film is really rather ace, it has some problems for sure (the effects were bad back then, never mind now and Ernie Hudson is a token addition to the team) but it\'s razor sharp with its wit and has a mass appeal to people of all ages. It\'s a basic odd ball\'s to the rescue plot, but the differing characterisations and comedy lift it considerably higher than similarly themed films that had come prior to it. That it boasts a bigger budget and Bill Murray of course helps the cause. Murray was brought in after Belushi had left the mortal coil, and promptly owns the film. His Dr. Venkman is a fusion of sarcasm, biting one liners and sees science as a way of getting girls. All of which blends mirthfully with the polar opposites that are Aykroyd\'s Stanz and Ramis\' Spengler. Sigourney Weaver lights up the screen as the soon to be possessed, and chased by Venkmen, Dana Barrett and Rick Moranis does meek goof-ball supreme as Louis Tully. There\'s also value to be found in the script courtesy of some political nudging as the mayor is aware of vote power, while the human element badness and cynicism comes from William Atherton\'s (suitably weasel like) stiff suit Walter Peck.\nGiven its success (it made a worldwide profit of almost $262 million) a sequel was inevitable.

The comedy is presented like a drama and that is usually the absolute best way to do comedy...straight.\nAnd conversely the remake is just sort of over the top. And when comedies try that hard to be comedies, they stop being funny.\nAnother part would be scene length. And again, playing it straight, the opening of 1984 is short and honestly kind of scary...\n...when the remake drags on and deals with characters that honestly have nothing else to do with the film but introduce it. You lose interest sort of fast.\nAnd this can be seen again with the humor. The introduction of the car in the remake is prime example. Pulls up with a hearse, someone makes a joke about checking to see if there is a body in there....\n...the scene SHOULD stop when they look at the hearse and cut away to a different scene. But the remake drags on and the joke loses momentum and falls flat when it COULD have been an easy laugh.\nConversely in 1984 you have jokes like the Twinkie that ends with ""tell him about the Twinkie"" and it is funny because it doesn\'t drag on in an effort to be funny. The same can be said about testing the proton packs, the joke ends fast enough for it to actually be funny.\nAnd then there is the script and direction, the 1984 version stuck to it and made sure everything was tight, even when it was improvised, it wasn\'t allowed to get out of control.\nBut the remake the actors took control and the improvisation went on too long, even with scenes being cut.\nSo what you have is a tight and fast film that is a comedy played straight like it should be...and one that everyone knows and loves because of it.'], ['50%', 'Probably since my childhood days I was fond of this movie, but now it is not impressive anymore.

Indeed it may well be that for this film, the less you actually know about the subject the more you might enjoy it. We start with the demise of Marie Antoinette and see Napoleon Bonaparte (Joaquin Phoenix) watching from the baying crowd. He\'s a relatively junior officer but an aspirational one who manages to sell a plan to relieve the British occupied city of Toulon to his boss Barras (Tahar Rahim). This success sets him on a parabola that sees him rise, his falling in/out/in of love with the charismatic Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) and his overwhelming desire for European domination. The narrative clearly illustrates the fickleness of dynastic politics, trust and betrayal, love, lust and shrieking hypocrisy in a colourful and vibrant fashion. I didn\'t love Phoenix in this role, but maybe because Rod Steiger was so convincing in ""Waterloo"" (1970) that at times he looked a little like a mimic. That said, though, he puts his heart and soul into the role and the increasingly toxic dynamic with Kirby manages to stay on the right side of melodrama throughout. Again, as with Sir Ridley\'s tale of Jerusalem from eighteen years ago, he manages to pull off some spectacular battle scenes and the cinematography captures well the hostile environments - human and natural - faced by the soldiers as his empire building rose and fell. Although it\'s over 2½ hours long, I felt the focus was rather imbalanced. A long time spent on his rise to power then his decline and fall rather rushed. Dare I say it, but this might have worked better as a part one and a part two scenario. It looks stunning and the creative forces behind the costumes and visual effects are bound to be picking up a slew of gongs in due course.

The movie, while visually stunning and energetically directed, suffers from an overly ambitious script and a plethora of historical inaccuracies that distract rather than enhance. Joaquin Phoenix\'s portrayal of Napoleon is inconsistent, struggling to meld the complex dichotomy of the character\'s reputed brilliance and egotism with a more vulnerable, human side.\nThe film\'s pacing is erratic, attempting to navigate through two decades of dense European history and personal drama within a limited runtime. Key events feel rushed or underexplored, leaving viewers longing for the depth and development that a miniseries format could provide. Vanessa Kirby\'s Josephine provides a glimmer of intrigue and depth, yet even her story feels truncated and secondary to the hurried historical epic. Overall, ""Napoleon"" exemplifies a missed opportunity to deeply explore one of history\'s most enigmatic figures, hinting that a more expansive, serialized approach might have better served such a monumental story'], ['-', 'Not worth the subject: the movie neglects completely how innovative Napoleon has been, just focusing on his relation with his wife.

None of the non-battle scenes did anything for me, it's all so heavily forgettable. The added humour/quirkiness from the titular character felt out of place, or at least wasn't blended with the more serious stuff all that well.\nThe long run time, whilst certainly overdone, isn't actually all that much of a hindrance - it's moreso how poorly the run time is utilized. I, fwiw, have zero issue with historical inaccuracies. Judging it solely as a film, I highly doubt I'll want to rewatch this anytime soon unfortunately.""], ['60%', ""I'm afraid Napoleon is a little boring.

Regrettably, the handling, like  Napoleons tryst with Josephine, is quick and crude. Set piece gives way to yet more set pieces,with no real contextual cohesion.\nThere are a number of historical inaccuracies too. The most glaring being the absence of a younger actor in the earlier part of Napoleons career.  This could have worked better with Joaquin Phoenix playing Napoleon in his latter years, married up to a actor of similar appearance, playing the younger Napoleon. Napoleon did change markedly over the years, why not take this approach?\nI will say too, I think the American accent that\'s pretty hard to ignore, does not sit well, with a production set in this era.Brit accents are more believable because they were a well established presence on the world stage, at the time. I wasn\'t always sure if I was watching a film about Napoleon or Washington. A role I think Phoenix would be fabulous in, BTW.\nThis is not to say this film is ""all negatives"". A ton of money has been spent on this lavish production and it shows. Sets are amazing, as are costumes and locations. The gruesomeness of warfare be it domestic, Royalists dispatched by cannon in the streets of Paris or enemies on the battlefield, is laid bare. This really brings home the fact that warfare and imperialism, which we still see today, is ultimately an ugly, sinister, destructive thing.\nIn summary, issues with the handling of this historical production are its biggest shortcoming. From the choice of approach, with almost obsessive set pieces, the use of an older actor in a younger role and other aspects of how the character is presented.\nOn the upside, lavish and at times, brutally frank, especially the bloody spectacle of conflict. There are no hero\'s in war, including Napoleon himself.\nNOTE: For anyone interested Napoleon was not short. He was around 5.7"" tall which was the male French average height for the century he was born in (height of people varied century to century based on factors like food availability).

Joaquin plays Napoleon role very well, even with the limitations of being just a caricature here.\nThe gaps and errors in historically accuracy and battle scenes tactics are just fathomless deep, and history is compressed as it where from a history book name and resume of chapter to another, loosing the chance to achieve something grandiose here.\nI can just dream on a well made screenplay and accurate movie here with the same quality of Ridley\'s work - nevertheless that it would take more than just one movie to get that chapter of Europe\'s history.\nMaybe it will get one or two nominations at Academy for production, costume or cinematography here but that\'s it.\nIf it was a historical movie of a lesser known character or just focused on one part of his life it the score could be higher but here I just can get a 6.0 out of 10.0 / B - (but with a A for the technical side).\nIt seems thar a version with 92 plus minutes will be released on Apple, but without a final director\'s cut version date.'], ['60%', ""Hearing over and over on the internet about how Napoleon led his army to die in the cold Russian winter, I always assumed he just died there along with them.

There’s nothing redeeming about it, with every decision either ill-conceived or mishandled to the point of incompetence. In Favreau’s hands, ‘The Lion King’ is rendered thunderously dull, lacking in any tension or complex characterisation, taking a laboriously long time to go nowhere and never once justifying its contentious existence. Even with my dislike of the original, I was flabbergasted at how thoroughly this film never attempts to understand why so many people love the 1994 film. If nothing else, this film makes it abundantly clear that Disney has no interest in making great cinema or honouring its own legacy. They don’t care whether the film is good or whether you enjoy it. All they care about is using nostalgia to trick you into buying your ticket so they can make as much money off you as they can, and maybe if they throw some recognisable iconic moments from your childhood on the screen, they may even be able to fool you into thinking you’d had a good time. ‘The Lion King’ is the ultimate diabolical apex of the commercialisation of nostalgia, and its inevitable box office success will just prove how easily we continue to be duped and how thoroughly they have trained us to not care about the quality of what we see.

Why? Well, the story might follow the same essential plot points, and the characters might have similar narrative paths, but there are so many details that make this movie stand on its own. From tiny little improvements to moments of the original that wouldn’t make sense in a realistic environment to adjustments to character’s backstory, musical moments or other significant parts. With that said, I need to discuss the controversy surrounding this remake, but I won’t take longer than one paragraph.\nPeople need to understand that these Disney’s remakes aren’t here to replace the originals. They’re here to honor them, and bring their stories and characters to this new century so that new generations can have an additional look at something they love, and 90s kids can remember why they love these films so much. Emphasis on the “additional” part of that sentence. Then, people also need to get their preferences right: would you want to watch a shot-for-shot remake or something entirely different? Or a blend of these two? If you don’t know what you want, you might be in danger of turning into a hypocrite if your speech goes from “I don’t want these copy-paste remakes” to “they changed that specific moment, why didn’t they keep it the same?” Just be clear on what you wish. If you simply don’t want Disney to do these remakes, then just don’t watch them. Don’t go online try to beat it to the ground with negative comments if you haven’t seen the movie. Moving on …\nI love it. I absolutely love it. I cried the exact same 4 times as I did in the 1994’s original. My whole body got chills during the opening sequence, which is one of a few things I love more about the remake than in the original. It’s NOT a shot-for-shot remake! I don’t understand how so many critics are calling it so. Either people’s memory of the original faded or someone clearly didn’t watch the same film. I can write a whole review of 1000+ words just describing the new stuff. Of course, the story goes through the same iconic moments in the same way, and some dialogues are extensively repeated, which was something that I was hoping they developed more. Despite that, I still feel that the scripts have a different take on it from the voice actors, even James Earl Jones.\nOne proof would be that I cried on a scene that I never felt like it in the original. I don’t know if it was how it was shot (one of the various different angles that the remake provides of known scenes) or if the dialogue just has more impact this time around, but the point here is that this remake is NOT a cheap copy-paste. I always look forward to seeing what they come up with to solve or adjust some questions that the originals leave us with. Let me just write that Jeff Nathanson has some truly brilliant changes/additions. Remember people criticizing Scar’s look when the first teaser came out? With just ONE WORD, its entire physical shape, scar, and past are explained. One word. Imagine that. There are little elements like adding a word or a sentence here and there, and it makes so much more sense with the character or the story in question.\nSpeaking of Scar, Chiwetel Ejiofor is astonishing. Scar might be my favorite character of the remake. He’s more menacing and scarier, his voice is darker, and his arc is better explored. Jeremy Irons will always have that iconic voice associated with the character, but Ejiofor did a crazily good job in replacing him. However, if there’s one voice that I could never watch another actor do is Mufasa’s. I have no words to express how emotionally powerful James Earl Jones’ voice is. As soon as he says “Simba” in the reflection scene, my eyes drop waterfalls. His voice is an emotional trigger, let’s call it that. I love Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) even more this time around. Their scenes are hilarious, and the characters’ relationship keeps being a standout. Oh, and if you were worried that the hula scene would never be as good let alone surpassed … You might need to rethink that. Also, I enjoyed the stretched last act (I found the original’s final battle too abrupt), and I would advise parents to be careful showing this remake to (very) young kids since the violence on display feels much more real (duh).\nJD McCrary and Shahadi Wright-Joseph (young Nala) are amazing, and their voices are crystal clear while singing. Donald Glover and Beyoncé (adult Nala) are also terrific, and their voices are even better. The new music Spirit fits better in this remake than Speechless in Aladdin. Moving on to the music, it’s another aspect that I genuinely think the remake does better. Hans Zimmer proves that he can bring an old score of his back to life in a much more robust, epic, and passionate way. Every song feels more prominent, every soundtrack feels a lot more impactful and stronger. Be Prepared is the only one that goes through a significant change, and while it might sound a bit strange at first, I love it more each time I listen to it. It’s a score that will never be forgotten, and this remake just helped people remember how great it is. Oscar-winning score.\nI left the best to last: the visuals. I can’t possibly describe how impressive and eyegasmic the CGI is. Animals talking was never an issue (people keep sharing GIFs or short clips and immediately started complaining that it looked awkward … a 30-seconds video without context watched on a laptop will never give you a hint of how the movie will actually be). Yes, the expressiveness of the original animation can’t be achieved, but going as far as saying that the film lacks soul or that the characters don’t emote is just inaccurate. You don’t need a PhD to understand that a lion with its ears down or up means different things. There are tiny little movements in the animals that are so complex that I’m still astounded how they were able to do it. If a bug flies near their faces, they flinch or move in such a characteristic way that I felt like I was truly watching real animals. Once again, Oscar-winning VFX.\nI don’t really have major problems with it. Minor gripes with a few things, but the biggest one would be the lack of more uniqueness. There’s no element of surprise in regards to the story or the character’s decisions. We always know what’s coming, so we’re prepared (no pun intended) for anything they through at us because, well, we’ve seen it before (with the exception of one particular scene that made me jump out of my chair and I think not a single person will be able to avoid it). I find the “animals don’t emote” argument one of the biggest nitpicks in the history of cinema. It might be true that they lack the emotion of the original animation, but going as far as saying that they show absolutely no emotion is just hating for the sake of hate. Same goes for people criticizing the fact that Can You Feel the Love Tonight is sung during broad daylight … In the original, it isn’t nighttime as well.\nFinally, I just want to address the “these remakes aren’t necessary / no one asked for these” discussion. No one asked for the 1994’s movie until it came out. People didn’t know they needed it. Seriously, everyone needs to realize that these remakes aren’t here to replace the originals. How many of you have watched The Lion King (1994) or showed it to someone in the past 10 years? How many times have you heard its score in the same period? I bet that most of the answers are simply “none”. That’s how important this remake is then! It makes you go back, it makes everyone remember how incredible the 1994’s film is, by keeping its essence while being able to stand on its own. Jon Favreau did a tremendous job, and I hope he gets recognized for it.\nIn the end, it doesn’t matter if the story is identical if we cry all the same. It doesn’t matter if we know what’s coming if we still feel nervous and worried about the characters. The Lion King (2019) is one of Disney’s best remakes so far, on par with The Jungle Book. Its VFX are game-changing, its score is more powerful and emotional than in the original, and the story carries the same heartfelt impact. James Earl Jones’ voice is everything. Timon and Pumbaa are even funnier. Ejiofor’s Scar is the best character in this remake. I have no flaws to point out, except that it follows the exact same path that the original’s story does. I wish it would be more distinct, but I can’t lie to myself, I love it deeply. One of 2019’s best movies. My #1 spot will be hard to decide… Go watch it! I can’t wait to see it again!\nRating: A'], ['30%', 'Vulgar Display of Dour\nFinal rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing.

A story which is not really bad and which adds a nice adventure aspect to the movie.\nThe movie even adds some realism, although they probably did not realize that during production, in that the federal agents are just as big a–holes as they have proven themselves to be in real life lately.\nThe grand finale with Dr Robotnik’s huge robot was quite hilarious.

I do not think it really deserves the glowing 9 or 10 star ratings that I have seen but it certainly do not merit those 1 or 2 star ones either. What were these people expecting?\nThis is a solid effort of making a movie along the classical lines of supernatural possession. As I wrote, it is not really something new, but it is nice to see a new movie using this kind of story without just turning it into a CGI gore-feast. Sure, the movie also includes the traditional pitfalls that most horror movies apparently must have like people thinking it is a good idea to walk down into the dark and scary basement all alone in the middle of the night.\nOne thing that irked me with the movie though was the idea of phantoms and performing exorcism being presented as kind of normal and accepted things. Of the movie would have played itself out 70 or so years earlier maybe but in the 1970′s? It just felt somewhat surreal to see this “ghosthunter” make presentations and talk to people like supernatural entities and the practice of exorcism was just things that happened.\nThe we have the ending of course. Not that it was overly bad but christ, if you are going to do an exorcism then do it damn it. Do not stop the procedure and look lost every time something goes bump.\nAnyway, I was not sure whether I was going to be disappointed or pleased when sitting down to watch this movie.

Free of gore and sex, this was automatically going to alienate a good portion of the lustful members of the horror fan base, but for those who like their horror served with appetising scares and a cauldron of suspense, then this delivers plenty to your particular table.\nForget the ""based on a true story"" tag, since it\'s kind of irrelevant in this new technological age, it\'s a selling gimmick that actually means ""this story might be true and we might have played with it a bit"". Regardless of hoax charges and embellishments, just buy into the premise, commit to it as a scary story in the same way as director James Wan has, for then the rewards are there for the compliant.\nStory essentially is based around an investigation in the early seventies by paranormal specialists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who aided the Perron family as they were victims of dreadful supernatural events at their Rhode Island home. Wan builds it deftly, letting us into the Perron families lives as they move into what they believe to be a dream home. Then things start to happen, but again Wan builds it in slow instances, creating a palpable sense of dread, his camera work intelligent. So when the big moments come they have maximum impact and have us also yearning for the Warren\'s to get involved.\nThere is no over killing of the boo-jump scares, they are placed with care and marry up superbly with the mounting tension. Naturally all the cliché conventions of the haunted house movie are here, strange smells, creaky doors, ominous cellar and etc, yet these are supplemented with Wan\'s talented knack for a good scare and a very effective production design. From mysterious bruises and literal leg pulls – breath holding games of hide and seek – to bona fide pant soiling moments, The Conjuring is a lesson in sustained unease until the big finale is unleashed.\nThe script is devoid of cheese and pointless filler, itself refreshing in a horror sub-genre that suffers often with these problems. Joseph Bishara\'s musical score is an absolute nerve shredder, and again it\'s a refreshing accompaniment because it doesn\'t resort to telegraphed shrieks to tell us to be afraid, it never overwhelms a scene. John Leonetti\'s cinematography has Gothic textures, both in the house and outside of the lakeside farmhouse, while the strong lead cast of Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston come up trumps for sure.\nMet with critical and box office success, The Conjuring justifies its reputation as a superb haunted house movie. 9/10'], ['50%', ""I'm a fan of Wan, and while I must say I believe that The Conjuring is pretty severely overrated, it's also one of the best horror films to have hit the mainstream in the past few years.\nFinal rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole.""], ['80%', ""Hadn't seen this in a while and watching it again in preparation for the third movie, found it to be well done.

James Wan really does develop this story with an effective degree of menace and Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor work well together as the parents scared out of their pants by the goings-on in their dream home that is turning into a nightmare that perhaps even an exorcism won\'t resolve. Joseph Bishara presents us with an eerily effective musical accompaniment to this story and the acrobatic and prosthetic visual effects all contribute effectively to create a real sense of malevolence that, unusually for many in this genre - it has a degree of plausibility too.

Doss, who strongly believes in that carries the same ideology to the combat zone. But all the initial part of the film reflects why he is very on to it. Especially after a fight with his brother in his childhood, followed by saving a severely injured man in a road accident just before deciding to join the army. So it is like both, a war film, as well as an anti-war theme. Most importantly, it tells us the bravery of a man, like of something Gandhi in the battlefield.\nHe did it in what he had believed, but my perspective differs. I liked the film, as a biopic and the message it delivered. Very entertaining too, but when it comes to Doss' belief, I think it was flawed. In the first place he would have not joined the army if he's true to the commandment. That's the basic rule of the commandment if one wants to adopt it.\nHe was just one of the unique person with such idea and luckily succeeded following it in a hostile situation.

Then after Pearl Harbour he enlists in service and we are then witness to boot camp, which comes with the horrors of bullying and ostracization due to Doss refusing to even touch a rifle - let alone use one! After the military based political thunder has exhausted its armoury, Doss and the rest of the 77th Infantry Division are sent to Okinawa to try and capture the Maeda Escarpment (Hacksaw Ridge). From where a true legend is born.\nAs is a Gibson trademark, the battle scenes are terrifyingly real and bloody as can be, the horrors of war laid bare for dramatic impact. Amongst the carnage, which is magnificently framed in smoky hazes and a landscape obliterated by weaponry, Doss (brilliantly brought to life by Garfield) comes to the fore. From within the madness comes humanity in its purest and most genuine form, and it makes for edge of the seat viewing whilst stirring the blood of those invested fully in this remarkable story. 9/10""], ['60%', 'Tribute to a real-life WW2 “conscientious collaborator”\nAfter Pearl Harbor, Desmond Doss of Lynchburg, Virginia, joins the US Army to become a medic and serves at the Battle of Okinawa. As a Seventh Day Adventist and conscientious objector, his goal was to save lives, not kill, which naturally causes problems with his fellow soldiers; until they observe his bravery in combat. Teresa Palmer is on hand as Doss’ potential babe while Vince Vaughn plays the drill sergeant.\nBased on a true story and directed by Mel Gibson, ""Hacksaw Ridge"" (2016) is a reverent and compelling WW2 flick that includes the usual training sequences in the first half balanced by intense combat sequences in the second. The unique factor here is that the brave protagonist refuses to use a weapon and is determined to only save lives in the midst of the insanity of war. This is an interesting real-life tale that needs to be told and “Hacksaw Ridge” is a good war movie only marred by laying on the heroics too thick as well as the lack of depth in the peripheral characters, which makes them uninteresting. The latter is in contrast to the outstanding “Platoon” (1986) which featured several well-defined characters.\nThe movie’s about an individual who believes in ABSOLUTE pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that refuses to ever turn to violence, even in response to evil or for the purpose of national defense. He thinks this is supported by the Bible and, specifically, the New Testament, but it isn’t. The Scriptures support LIMITED pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that only resorts to violence when justified. Christ\' instructions to ""turn the cheek"" related to responding to a backhanded slap to the face, which was an insult in that culture. In other words, we could all save ourselves a lot of trouble in life if we learn to ignore the antagonism of various morons who would like to divert our focus and ruin our day. The Old Testament teaches this as well: ""A fool shows his annoyance at once, but a prudent man overlooks an insult"" (Proverbs 12:16). So Christ was talking about giving an antagonist a break for the sake of peace in situations of personal offense; he wasn\'t referring to cases of severe criminal acts or defense of one’s nation.\nFor proof, Jesus\' ministry team had a treasury box and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves/murderers in their travels. You see, Christ & his disciples weren’t absolute pacifists. On two occasions, the Messiah got a whip out and chased all the fools out of the Temple – throwing over tables, swinging the whip and yelling. He was a Holy Terror, pure & simple, and this caused the legalistic religious leaders to fear him and plot murder (Mark 11:15-18). Harmless pacifists don\'t inspire fear and provoke murder plots. Moreover, Romans 13 clearly states that the righteous laws of human governments are ordained of God for the purpose of punishing criminals, domestic & foreign, who threaten the lives of citizens. This includes the right to execute when appropriate. The majority of sane Christians realize this, but there are a few extremists, like Doss in the movie, who refuse to be balanced with the Scriptures on this matter and insist that violent conflict is never appropriate. They’re wrong. Sometimes it’s necessary, like after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, unprovoked, murdering over 2300 innocents and wounding 1100.\nThe film runs 2 hour, 19 minutes, and was shot in New South Wales, Australia.\nGRADE: B-'], ['80%', ""A really good movie, which only lacks in some details.\nThis was not the first war film directed by Mel Gibson. He had previously made at least one military-themed film, “We Were Soldiers”, set in Vietnam. However, it is a film that addresses much more human and intimate themes, in my opinion, by following the Doss family, a family from rural Virginia, and the trajectory of one of their children, Desmond.\nSon of an extraordinarily devout mother, raised an Adventist, Desmond learns as a child to deny violence (the film shows a fight between brothers that could have ended very badly, but in real life it was a fight between Desmond's father and his brother-in-law) and to strictly follow his faith and religion. When the US joins the Allies in World War II, the brothers decide to enlist, but Desmond insists on doing so on his own terms, that is, as a combat rescuer, exempt from the use and carrying of any weapon. Of course, the US military isn't going to take this in the best light.\nThe film exposes itself in a somewhat lengthy way and captures our sympathy very well, but despite many people complaining that the first part of the film is slow and tiring, I felt this more in the prolonged combat scenes, despite understanding what led Gibson to detail them so exhaustively. Still, it is necessary to be frank: they are excellent battle scenes, with rich details and a very accentuated degree of rawness. Unfortunately, the dialogues aren't very good, they sound a bit cliché, and it's annoying to see that in a movie with so many qualities. The film also makes efforts to create a romantic subplot around Desmond's first wife, but things don't go well, and the material is frankly poor.\nIn general, Gibson does a good job of directing, although that won't come as a surprise to the most attentive observer. He already has a number of hits in his filmography and, together with Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper, is one of the actors I most like to see in the director's chair. Until now, I never really considered the value of the actors involved in this project. Some I just don't know very well. Andrew Garfield is an example: I've seen him in other works, but the actor never completely convinced me, so I was very impressed with his work here. Sam Worthington also impressed me very well, although he's an actor I recognize more easily, and I've seen him work well in other films. Hugo Weaving is excellent, and Vince Vaughn also deserves praise. Only Teresa Palmer seems to have more difficulty to disentangling herself from the work at hand, perhaps due to the weak material received.\nTechnically, the film has a lot of good things to look at, starting with the reasonably rigorous way in which Gibson seeks to re-enact the combat and war environment, from the recruiting camp to the field. Unlike many films from his past, where the director trampled on historical truth, he seems to make sincere efforts to respect it here. The visual and special effects are really very good, and the CGI used is truly excellent and gives the film a remarkable realism, especially in the combat scenes. The sets are interesting and the costumes too. I especially liked the old uniform that Weaving wears in a brief scene, given the difference with the uniforms in use at the time. The cinematography takes advantage of all this and more, and the camera moves intelligently, putting us in the fight, making us suffer with those soldiers, and feel what they felt, what Gregson's soundtrack -Williams accentuates even more.""], ['100%', ""I don't want to say that I dislike Mel Gibson as an actor, I mean he's been in plenty of movies that I love... but like Clint Eastwood, he makes a FAR better director than he ever made an actor.\nHacksaw Ridge is just one of those films where he does a great job... unfortunately it is Mel Gibson, so it's over-the-top carnage that is not at all underplayed. But you can't fault Gibson for making a Gibson film, you should really know as much coming in.\nAnd he actually got Andre Garfield to act, which might not win him a reward, but it certainly should, that is a something that could get a man canonized... and it was his involvement that made me mistakenly put off viewing it for a few years. He seems like a real actor in this, accent and all.\nAnd then, of course, it's the story of a pacifist who went to war to save lives... and in the end that's pretty noble by the strictest definition and you feel it though out, which is probably the point... despite the over-the-top carnage.""]]"

Still, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, Killers of the Flower Moon might not be a gangster film, but there are many 'mob' elements within it.\nThe biggest fear people had going into this film was the runtime. Weeks before the release, speculations came out about the length of this film. I saw an article stating it would be 4 hours long! Alas, it's only 206 minutes long, not even coming close to the longest film here at Cannes. I can confirm that the film never drags its feet for too long; there are times when it slows down, but this is only during the film's opening hour. Thankfully it quickly picks up the pace and goes by fast once the whole ensemble is introduced. Jesse Plemons is a late bloomer in the film, only being introduced 2 hours in; as I said, this is where the film starts moving.\nThe story is simple: During the 1920s, oil was discovered on Osage Nation Land.

I hear talks about the Oscars for her, which is entirely valid. De Niro steals many of the scenes he's in, often providing the most laughs. He is ultimately the most 'mob-like character within the film, never pulling the trigger but commanding the troops. Jesse Plemons is the final major character within the story as Tom White. Unfortunately, Plemon's isn't that interesting; I wonder if Plemons wasn't given much direction or if he decided to make the character this way. Still, White moves from scene to scene without much interest. He's just there, leading the FBI but never being an individual; I didn't remember his name after the film; I just referred to him as 'FBI guy.'\nTechnically, Killers of the Flower Moon is a marvel (Not that Scorsese would like me saying the word 'Marvel'), but just like all of his films, everything is great. Nothing stands out as 'excellent'; the score, editing and cinematography are at the level you'd expect from the mind of Scorsese.\nThis leads me to my final thoughts on the film; recently, Martin has been talking about his age and his ability to make films like he used to. Scorsese is 80 years old and doesn't believe he has the same drive as Ridley Scott. Suppose this is to be his final film.

He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners.

Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It\'s Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband\'s avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones.

This fact-based saga chronicles attempts by unscrupulous, two-faced White swindlers clandestinely (and sometimes quite brazenly) seeking to steal the considerable assets of wealthy Osage Indians in Oklahoma in the 1920s after oil is discovered on their land. This tragic tale explores the depths that these immoral criminals would go to (including murder) in the name of unabashed greed, efforts ironically spearheaded by the local, smiling, allegedly well-meaning sheriff (Robert DeNiro) with the help of his dimwitted nephew (Leonardo DiCaprio), especially in their scheme to shamelessly pilfer the wealth of the accomplice’s own wife (Lily Gladstone). The sweeping scope of this offering is indeed impressive, effectively brought to life by the fine performances of the three principals and an excellent ensemble of supporting players. And the stellar cast is backed by proficiently executed work in an array of technical areas, including production design, writing, cinematography and the original background score, making for a gorgeous picture to look at, all of which have earned “Flower Moon” a boatload of awards season nominations, with more undoubtedly to follow. However, the runtime of 3:26:00 – with no intermission – is a challenge to manage, even for the most patient and tolerant moviegoer. I streamed it, watching it in two parts, almost as if it were more of a TV miniseries than a standalone film, the only way I could effectively see myself getting through it. This handling of the story, in my opinion, represents something of a significant miscalculation by the filmmaker and the film editing staff – either cut the picture (which could have been done without losing much) or add a much-needed break partway through (which could have been accomplished without inhibiting the story’s continuity). In my view, I believe that the second half was far better and more compelling than the first and that some of the narrative’s more incidental detail could have easily been dispensed with without affecting the overall quality of the release. Still, that aside, it’s obvious that this project was a labor of love for the director, one with a clear vision of what it wanted to say in relating an important and little-known story of injustice in a nation that professes to be a staunch champion of truth and virtue, and, for that, we should be thankful for the enlightenment provided here.

Looking at the numbers, The Nun holds the box office record, being the most successful movie of the saga financially, but ironically enough, it\'s also the most disliked film by both critics and audience members. The viral marketing campaign obviously hyped this spin-off to an unbelievable level of expectation, but it\'s still strange that it took five years to deliver another The Conjuring flick since both previous installments were tremendously profitable as well.\nWith James Wan out of the director\'s chair and without a screenplay credit, my expectations weren\'t exactly high. Wan is one of the main reasons why The Conjuring movies work so well. From his ability to generate an enormous amount of suspense to the actually scary atmosphere, Wan is definitely one of the best horror directors of the last decade. Therefore, replacing him would always be a challenging task. Michael Chaves directed The Curse of La Llorona, a generic, bland horror flick that didn\'t have a single surprising element. However, I did compliment Chaves\' work with the horror sequences since I did find them somewhat effective. So, I was still feeling optimistic about The Devil Made Me Do It...\nIt\'s admittedly the weakest film of the trilogy, but it\'s still far from the awful Annabelle Comes Home or the hideous origin story about the famous nun. When it comes to the main titles, the exceptional production value is something all have in common. In fact, this latest flick is arguably the best-looking one. The horror sequences look stunning on the big screen, and the sound design is extremely impactful as always. It\'s worth remembering that this franchise doesn\'t waste hundreds of millions to make its movies, being a relatively low-budget cinematic universe, especially when compared to every other studio\'s massive sagas. Practical effects are always the go-to if possible, keeping the use of CGI to the minimum.\nActing-wise, it\'s also where these films triumph. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga share palpable chemistry, deeply elevating their characters\' emotional connection. At its core, The Conjuring features a love story between Ed and Lorraine Warren, ultimately being their grounded, convincing, loving relationship that keeps the viewers interested in the least ""based on a true story"" events. Both actors deliver remarkable performances, as does the legendary John Noble (The Lord of the Rings, Fringe) as a former priest. I didn\'t know about his casting before the movie, so I was genuinely surprised by seeing Noble on the big screen again. He\'s absolutely phenomenal, as expected, and quite creepy as a mysterious character.\nEveryone else is decent enough, but I don\'t find any other interpretation worth noting. Unfortunately, this is as far as I can go compliment-wise. The primary narrative surrounding the actual case that gives the name to the film is nowhere near as interesting as the stories told in the previous The Conjuring movies. The case itself doesn\'t have much to tell, so the majority of the film rests on following the beloved couple going on side quests as detectives. Eventually, the clues found are connected to the main plot, but overall, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick\'s screenplay isn\'t that captivating. Despite the predictability and formulaic horror elements, there\'s a rather enjoyable ""twist"" to the whole ""demon possession"" routine that marks the entire franchise.\nThe biggest disappointment is something I feared would happen without James Wan at the helm. The once terrifying, suspenseful atmosphere during the effective, creative jumpscare sequences now gives place to the generic build-up that viewers experience in some of the cheapest horror movies of today. Due to a character\'s health issue, the tension levels are constantly high for this person in particular, but for most of the runtime, the general environment lacks the essential scary feeling. The jumpscares look lazy and too obvious, a cliche that The Conjuring films fought hard to distance themselves from. In addition to this, it\'s a much darker movie than the rest in terms of lighting.\nFinally, I have mixed feelings about the ending. Without spoiling it, of course, it\'s similar to A Quiet Place Part II in the sense that two different sequences need to be edited together seamlessly so the viewers can easily follow what\'s happening without losing the tension and suspense. One of these scenes is particularly shaky, repetitive, and overly dark, which definitely left me a bit disappointed. Peter Gvozdas and Christian Wagner\'s editing is really good, though. Michael Burgess\' cinematography offers a couple of gorgeous shots, and Joseph Bishara\'s score maintains the ominous tone of the franchise. James Wan is clearly missed, but Michael Chaves didn\'t do a bad job.\nThe Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is undoubtedly the weakest installment of the trilogy, but it\'s still quite far from the awful level of the worst films of the horror franchise. Boasting the trademark terrific production value of the saga, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga deliver outstanding lead performances as the only two emotionally compelling characters. Overall, every element is lesser than the previous The Conjuring movies. From the less scary atmosphere to the unimaginative, generic jumpscares, Michael Chaves isn\'t able to replicate James Wan\'s tremendous levels of suspense and tension, despite a brilliant opening sequence. David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick\'s screenplay focuses on many storylines indirectly connected to the main plot, ending up with a not-that-interesting narrative that doesn\'t quite justify the main title. Some technical attributes, mainly the editing and cinematography, as well as sound design, compensate with some entertainment. In the end, I still recommend it to fans of the cinematic universe and lovers of the horror genre.\nRating: B-'], ['70%', ""Decent enough third entry that gets a little goofy at the end but I liked it, though not quite as good as the first two.

It has been proven time and time again that these things are what is required for a good Superhero film.""], ['-', 'Growing up I was a regular viewer of the Shazam and Isis “Super Power Hour” on television. Back before the days of mega-budgeted Super Hero movies; we had to content ourselves with cartoons and low budget television offerings which did their best to capture the look and action of comic characters within the budget and technology limits they had to deal with.\nWarner Bros. has brought their latest DC hero to the big screen with “Shazam!” and it looks to launch a new franchise for the studio and build on the success of “Wonder Woman” and “Aquaman” following some earlier disappointments with their planned hero franchise films.\nThe film follows the story of young Billy Batson (Asher Angel), who has grown up in and fled several Foster Homes after being lost at a Carnival years earlier and unable to find his mother. Billy has never stopped trying to find her and even takes extreme measures to try to find her that has gotten him in trouble with the law.\nWhile trying to stick up for a family member at his latest Foster Home; Billy is forced to flee from some local goons and finds himself facing an ancient Wizard (Djimon Honsou; who tells him he will now have superior powers when he speaks his name as he is now a guardian against the forces of evil.\nBilly does not believe this but upon uttering the name; he transforms into a powerful hero in adult form. Zach Levi plays the title hero and soon finds himself eager to test his new powers and his Super Hero obsessed Foster Brother is more than happy to mentor him and make all sorts of viral videos of his efforts and training.\nTheir efforts soon draw the attention of an evil individual (Mark Strong), who covets the power Billy has for himself as along with the Seven Deadly Sins; he looks to become an unstoppable force for evil and sets out to destroy all that stands in his way.\nThe film is aimed more for a younger audience as much of the humor is squarely focused on Middle School level jokes. There are more than a few references to “Big” along the way which does sum up a good portion of the backstory as when he is in hero form; the young boy without a family is a popular and dynamic adult.\nIn many ways this was one of the more odd aspects of the film. Billy is a dour and untrusting individual most of the time; however when he is hero form he is a jovial and goofy individual who acts like a teenager. I could see an increase in confidence but it is odd considering that they are the same person.\nLevi is very energetic in the part and goes all in and he does a great job of conveying a kid in a man’s body. The biggest issue with the film is that there is mostly a lot of humor aimed at a much younger audience and large gaps with minimal action which made sitting through numerous childish antics a bit tedious at times.\nDespite this; the film was entertaining and one of the better adaptions of a comic. The door is wide open for future adventures and I look forward to seeing what they come up with next.\n3.5 stars out of 5'], ['80%', 'If you enjoy reading my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog :)\nFirst of all, I didn’t know anything about Shazam. What his powers were, what story did he have … Basically, I didn’t know who he was. This is what David F. Sandberg‘s movie does best: introduce the audience to a new DC superhero, by delivering an uncommonly well-structured comic-book screenplay, packed with laughter and entertaining action. Zachary Levi is undoubtedly the standout! Not only is he hilarious, but he perfectly captures the childlike personality that a kid-turned-adult would have. His expressions of absolute surprise and awe of his powers are extremely precious, and he effortlessly carries the more lighthearted tone on his shoulders.\nAsher Angel is brilliant as Billy Batson. His character has a notably well-written and well-explored backstory, which eventually justifies the person he has become. It’s the most emotional and heartfelt subplot of the film (probably the only one, really), and Henry Gayden did a fantastic job writing its script. It doesn’t feel cliche or over-the-top, it actually feels grounded and quite realistic. Jack Dylan Grazer plays his best friend, Freddy Freeman, and he’s the primary source of self-aware comedy. He knows all the cliches regarding superheroes and supervillains, so his jokes constantly land and play seamlessly into the last act.\nUsually, villains tend to be hollow characters with paper-thin motivations, but since a few years ago, this issue has gradually been corrected. The latest comic-book movies have incredibly well-developed villains, who carry a compelling backstory that entirely supports their beliefs, but not their actions. This type of villains work because not only the audience can understand where they come from, but in some cases, they can even connect with and care about them. Dr. Thaddeus Sivana is not exactly someone the audience ends up caring about, but his backstory is emotionally powerful enough for us to understand where his motivations originate from. Mark Strong delivers a menacing performance, and his costume/make-up looks pretty badass.\nThe first act is kind of a mixed bag. It starts in a very captivating way, and once you understand who’s the character at the center, it gets even better. However, the film’s tone takes long to establish itself, and the beginning of the movie struggles to find which jokes land and which don’t. The humor is on-point throughout the rest of the runtime, but those first few jokes not so much, which threw me off a little bit. The action sequences are amazing, and the sound design allows the audience to feel every punch, kick, a fall on the ground or a Superman-ish take-off. The fight sequences are seamlessly edited, and you know how much I love well-choreographed or well-edited action scenes.\nShazam‘s search for his powers provides the funniest and most entertaining moments of the film. Each test that he puts himself through is both hilarious and informative. This is another aspect of the screenplay I love so much: they had several ideas of how to approach this segment, and they nailed every single execution. From the pop-culture references to the hero-villain cliches, Sandberg did a terrific job exploring those concepts, and he executed them flawlessly. The best jokes are the ones that can be funny on different levels for different people. If people can laugh at a particular scene solely due to it, but other people can laugh even more because that moment means so much more to them, that’s when you know a joke is perfect. Shazam is not only funny for comic-book fans, everyone can leave the theater entertained and jolly.\nIt’s still a straightforward superhero movie. There’s still a villain to defeat, and the film goes through all of the cliches that it makes so much fun of. Everyone knows how it’s going to develop, plot point by plot point, a few minutes in. Not that I consider this a flaw, it’s just … It is what it is. The final battle drags too much, and it keeps ending and restarting every five minutes. It does have a pretty cool conclusion, but it takes a bit too long to get there. Also, and I know that this is one of those logical nitpicks that CinemaSins are known for digging, but the flashbacks and time-jumps could have received better treatment concerning the age of the characters. One thing is to think that the characters would look much older/younger than what they display on-screen, but when they make them look exactly the same in the span of 30/40 years … Not so acceptable.\nAll in all, Shazam is a blast! It’s the most entertaining movie I’ve seen so far this year, and it’s freaking hilarious. It continues the comic-book films trend to change how villains are written, by delivering a well-developed bad guy, menacingly portrayed by Mark Strong. Every member of the cast gives a strong performance, but Zachary Levi steals the show. His whimsical attitude, reckless personality, and rich facial expressions are guaranteed to entertain you for most of the runtime. Asher Angel and Jack Dylan Grazer are outstanding as the young kids, and the former’s backstory carries emotional impact which passes on to the big guy he transforms himself into.\nThe action is packed with beautifully-edited sequences, powerful sound design, and cool, unique moments, but the supposedly climactic final battle drags too much. The first act struggles to find its rhythm and its tone, but once it gets going, it’s an exceptional journey. The best praise I can give Sandberg‘s movie is that I didn’t know anything about Shazam before entering the theater, and now I can’t wait for its sequel.

The film had a very interesting look and  that really caught my attention. I noticed that the film focused primarily on race, which seemed like an interesting concept for a horror/psychological thriller. I also saw that Jordan Peele (of ""Key and Peele"" fame) was the director of the film and I was thrown completely off about what type of movie I was going to get.\nFirst Impressions\nTo start off, this film is gorgeous and this presents itself fairly early into the film. Gorgeous quality, gorgeous scenery, gorgeous people. Added with the minimal soundtrack, the film seems very open. Many horror movies try to go for a claustrophobic approach, while ""Get Out"" uses its spacious atmosphere to bring out the unnerving fear of the unknown.\nGoing Smoothly\nOther than a few moments of ""How exactly is this scientifically possible?,"" you do not have to suspend your belief too often throughout the film. ""Get Out"" has an easy to follow, coherent story line that is aided by its pacing. Honestly, this is some of the best pacing have seen a modern horror film in a long time. Every sequence in this film seems to take the same amount of time and keeps the film moving along at a brisk pace. Every scene is refreshing and contains a new bit of information, instead of lingering on unimportant details. Every sequence is shot with purpose.\nGetting to Know the Cast\nThe acting in this movie is very well done. The interactions between characters seemed genuine and characters reacted to situations in appropriate manners. This isn\'t your average horror movie where the characters make stupid decisions to continue the plot; it all seems very organic. The characters act in a manner that you really connect with and do things that you could see yourself doing in these situations.\nFurther Considerations\nAs I mentioned earlier, the film was directed by Jordan Peele, who has almost exclusively worked in comedy. As a fan of ""Key and Peele"" skits and their major film, ""Keanu,"" I thought I had this film figured out before going to see it. With its subject matter about race, I figured this movie would be more of a joke than it was a straight-up horror film. And while the film is a very witty satire on race relations in America and features some very humorous dialogue and situations, the film drives the horrors of racism to the furthest point. The humor stems mostly from the absurdity of the films premise.\nThat Ending\nI do not have any major complaints about the movie. It didn\'t drag on, it mimicked reality, and gave me some very uneasy feelings, which is a plus for a horror film. The only problem I have with the film is the ending. It wraps itself up way too quickly and throws everything at you all at once. Luckily, the ending does resolve itself and doesn\'t leave any glaring loose ends. The film does end a bit too abruptly for my taste and it would have been nice to see what happens afterwards.\nClosing\nI would recommend this film to anybody looking for a different horror experience. It is tasteful and tame compared to other films, but it certainly doesn\'t distract from its purpose.'], ['-', 'Horror and comedy have blended well since around the beginning of film for one key reason: the release that both allow from the audience. The building set-up is not unlike the quiet before the jump scare. Both utilize equations of timing to provoke an unconscious reaction. Because of these similarities, the horror-comedy is a well-tapped genre, especially in the last couple decades of works aiming their trajectory at the cult DVD bin. So it takes a particular level of skill to mine new ground in the territory, particularly from a first time director.

I've been thinking about it for a while, and yesterday I took the opportunity to do so. I already had a notion that it was a very successful film, and that it was successful at the box office and with specialized critics. For a horror movie, that's pretty good stuff. For my part, I think it's a good film, well above average. It's a tense film, that works well with the environment... and yes, it has scary moments. Nominated for Best Film, Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay, it won an Oscar in the latter category.\nThe script works, mostly, on the issue of more educated racism, maintained and cultivated by the white elites of some North American circles where, without harassing blacks, they are seen as “rare birds” in the environment where they are. Afterwards, the film departs from this base to something denser and darker: the protagonist begins to realize that the people in that family act strangely, and that the black people who are there seem to be automatons. It's worth seeing what happens next...\nThis film seeks, in every way, to escape the stigma of American terror: the scares that, due to the action of the effects, make us jump in our seats. Seeking to give us more, he works a lot with the environment, and the tension gradually builds up as our sympathy for the main character grows. And that's the strong point of the film, and what makes it different, on the positive side. Jordan Peele did a very competent job directing, and showed that he understands horror and can give the genre a breath of fresh air. And this becomes even more relevant if we consider an aspect already highlighted by many people: he was a complete novice when he directed the film.\nRegarding the performances, I think it's fair to value Daniel Kaluuya's performance, more than committed and tense. He was really very good and if the film works so well, in part, it is due to this very competent actor. Allison Williams also leaves a good performance. I especially liked Catherine Keener's work. She does a very small job, appears for a short time in the film, but is very impactful.\nDespite not being a big budget film, I think I knew how to make the best use of every coin and prove that a good film doesn't really need to be expensive to make. The cinematography is very good, it is within the standard of current films, but it does its job very well. The sets and costumes don't stand out much either, although we have to highlight some quality notes, such as the clothes of some characters and, very in particular, the room where one of the characters ends up imprisoned. The visual and sound effects are good, and are used with intelligence and care.

The plan is to relocate the dinosaurs to a new island sanctuary, but that’s not the way it works out.\nMy title blurb pretty much says it all for this fifth film in the franchise. I mention Indiana Jones because the movie has a “Raiders of the Lost Ark” (1981) vibe more so than the other movies.

I think Christ Pratt, and most of the other actors as well for that matter, did a fairly good job out of the lousy script. The idea of using a Stygimoloch to break free was quite cool and the havoc he wreaked somewhat funny. The part where Wheatley stop in the middle of all the chaos to extract a tooth as a bloody trophy was just silly though.\nThe end scenes was just frustrating. However wrote that ought to be shot.

The film wasn't even the only supervillain animation to hit the theaters that year, but it did one-up its rival Megamind both in critical acclaim and commercial success.\nNow, the original film's creative team returns with Despicable Me 2, continuing the adventures of former supervillain-cum-adopted father Gru, his precocious daughters Margo, Edith, and Agnes, and his little, yellow, nonsense-spouting minions. Following closely on the first film's heels (this film gratifyingly puts a premium on continuity), the now-retired Gru is settling into his new paternal role, and while the spikier parts of his personality remain, he's reshaped himself into an adoring father and potential purveyor of jams (and jellies). When an evil plot threatens the globe, however, Gru finds himself pulled back into the supervillain game by the Anti-Villain League, who've recruited him to be the hero, an ersatz spy who knows how the mystery bad guy thinks. One earnest and delightfully overbearing partner introduction later, the pair (Gru and newbie AVL agent Lucy Wilde, played by Kristen Wiig) are undercover as bakers in a strip mall where the bad guy's scheme is likely to go down.\nDespite the world being threatened, the stakes feel surprisingly low in the film; the archness of the plot never feels as real or immediate as the character interactions, which are enjoyable all the way through. Here, Gru realizes his loneliness, his neophyte partner realizes her true calling, and his daughters come to grips with new realizations and wishes. The characters take center stage, rarely letting the transparently-raised stakes of the plot machinations get in the way of sitcom-like character arcs such as the eldest daughter dating (and Gru's dogged insistence on undermining it) or little Agnes wanting a new mother. But that's sort of the magic of these films; despite the plot beats being the stuff of basic sitcoms, the setting and characters manage to still make the film a winning combination.\nSteve Carell dusts off the strange Eastern European accent he originated for Gru, and manages to be both an amusing character and his own straight man. Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, and Elsie Fisher embody adorableness as the girls. But it's Wiig who steals the show as Agent Wilde, a professional woman who is also goofy and personable. Wiig and Carell have fantastic chemistry, even with just their voices in play.\nThe minions, those little yellow blobs in overalls that accompany all of the film's publicity, are back and hilarious as ever, despite their laser-like focus on slapstick and complete lack of intelligible dialogue. The Despicable films seem to be two separate animation genres welded together: the first is a heartfelt, Pixarian meditation on the nature of family, but the second is the part with the minions, which embody the anarchic spirit of the Looney Tunes more successfully than any of their predecessors. It's a strange melange that shouldn't work, but dammit, it does, and the resulting films wound up being both moving and guffaw-inducing.\nThe other aspect of the Despicable films that bowls me over is the virtual cinematography; truly, alongside the best of Pixar's output (like Wall-E), these are some of the most beautiful animated films ever made. The use of color, depth, and art are stunning, from Gru's Charles Addams-inspired design to the beautiful play of light, shadow, and color. This sequel follows the high standards of the first, and the result is a feast for the eyes.\nThe bottom line is that like the first film, this one is a trifle, but a very enjoyable one. It's little more than a victory lap for Carell and company, but when there are characters you can enjoy this much, what's wrong with spending another couple of hours with them?""]]"

Thankfully, Warner Bros. decided to release Wonder Woman 1984 before the year\'s end, but not without a catch. Most people will only have the possibility of watching one of the few blockbusters of 2020 through HBO Max, a streaming service only available in a couple of countries, while some incredibly lucky moviegoers might have the chance of seeing this visually epic film in theaters, depending on the country\'s pandemic rules.\nFortunately, I\'m one of those lucky people who got the opportunity to end 2020 on a positively immersive note by watching Patty Jenkins\' latest flick in an almost empty IMAX theater (paradise). If you\'ve been following me for some time, you know I\'m a firm believer and defender of the so-called ""theater experience"", and I can\'t hide the fact that I felt extremely emotional going into one of the best, biggest theaters in Portugal to witness one of my Most Anticipated Movies of 2020. Until 2017, DCEU struggled to deliver a massively loved installment, and Wonder Woman came to the rescue. It was one of my favorite films of the respective year, so I was obviously excited for its sequel, even more having in mind the circumstances we\'re all living in.\nIn my opinion, this sequel stands close to its predecessor. With a lengthy runtime known for being associated with absolutely epic movies, I was confident that WW84 could deliver a solid film with great villains for a change. Well, Kristen Wigg and Pedro Pascal are definitely two of the indisputable standouts. Patty Jenkins, Geoff Johns, and David Callaham made the right decision in dedicating a significant portion of the screenplay to Barbara Minerva and Max Lord. Their arcs are far from being groundbreaking, but they\'re a thousand times more effective than the ""CG punch bag"" narrative.\nBarbara follows the ""lonely, insignificant, no one cares about me"" archetype, and Wiig does a surprisingly remarkable job in portraying this character, but the script is what really makes her shine. At first, her comedic mannerisms left me a bit dubious about the eventual character\'s likeness. However, as time flies by, it\'s almost inevitable to feel sorry for Barbara, making her future motivations understandable and perfectly natural. On the other hand, Max Lord is apparently exploding with conviction, but his life is not as amazing as everyone might think. This time, it\'s Pedro Pascal who ends up elevating the character, delivering a brilliant performance with just the right amount of over-the-top expressions.\nEven though these two are magnificent, Gal Gadot continues to prove that she\'s one of the best casting choices of the millennium, interpreting Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman. I seriously cannot imagine another actress wearing that costume, throwing that Lasso of Truth, incorporating the character\'s essence as seamless as Gadot. In this movie, she was able to perform highly emotional scenes, nailing every single one. Her chemistry with Chris Pine (Steve Trevor) is palpable on the other side of the world, and their interactions go through every zone of the emotion spectrum. Regarding Steve, I\'m not going to spoil how he comes back or anything concerning his arc, but I can safely write that his presence in the film is both necessary and logical.\nThe biggest compliment I\'ll offer this sequel concerns its screenplay and direction. Finally, I can confidently write that the DCEU is capable of producing a well-structured, well-developed story with well-written characters. It doesn\'t have as much action as the original, but I still didn\'t feel the 151 minutes. WW84 flows incredibly well due to Jenkins\' ability to fill up the runtime (almost) only with important scenes. There\'s a slight ""over-persistence"" in the attempt at sending a certain message (I\'ll get there), but story-wise, I sincerely wouldn\'t take a second out. Even the comic relief moments, particularly with Pine (who plays some sort of parallelism with the first movie\'s Diana), are welcome and timely.\nThe action scenes might be low on quantity, but the few that the audience gets are long, complex, and technically challenging to pull off. The opening sequence alone almost made me tear up due to its epicness. Hans Zimmer\'s powerful score, Richard Pearson\'s clean editing, and Matthew Jensen\'s camera work all work together to present a lengthy, grand, wide view of an Olympics-style obstacle course with young Diana. Throughout the entire film, the action is colorful, vibrant, fun, and entertaining… except for the (supposedly) climactic clash.\nWell, to be fair, there are two climaxes during the last thirty minutes since WW84 owns two antagonists to play with. One of them is closed in perfect fashion, with the emotional stakes at their highest. Great job there, no complaints whatsoever. However, the main fight sequence inexplicably contrasts with the rest of the movie\'s action. The vibrant colors disappear and are replaced by a dull grey, which makes one of the characters involved (who shares the same color tone) hard to notice, transforming an epic final battle into an underwhelming, barely comprehensible collection of awkward cuts, punches, and screams. Gadot\'s golden suit is way less exciting (and poorly lit) than her original costume, and Barbara\'s arc ends without real closure.\nIn addition to this, Jenkins insists too much on passing to the audience that greed brings horrible consequences. ""Be careful what you wish for"", ""money and power can\'t buy happiness"", ""be thankful for what you have"", and messages along these lines are repeated continuously (implicitly and explicitly). I admit that it might be a nitpick of mine and that not many people will feel like I did, but I couldn\'t help but feel that some moments sounded and/or seemed a bit preachy and way too repetitive. Also, it\'s a bit weird how the official premise mentions Wiig as Cheetah, but this word is not mentioned once in the entire film… Nevertheless, don\'t be mistaken: I\'m thrilled that WW84 is the last flick I watch at a theater this year!\nAll in all, Wonder Woman 1984 proves that DC continues on the track of success by delivering a well-structured, well-developed DCEU installment without an absurd amount of overwhelming CGI and/or forgettable villains. Patty Jenkins, Geoff Johns, and David Callaham\'s impressively layered screenplay makes the lengthy runtime feel adequate not only by offering epic, exciting, technically superb action set pieces, but also due to the remarkably well-written heroes and antagonists. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are outstanding together, but Kristen Wiig and Pedro Pascal steal the show as the newcomers. With two wonderful ""villains"", WW84 boasts a solid, elaborate narrative that I was lucky to witness on the big screen. Unfortunately, the climactic battle is disappointingly underwhelming and colorless, Barbara\'s arc ends abruptly without true closure, and Jenkins insists too much on the thematic message of the story. These issues may affect more viewers or not, but one thing\'s for sure: it\'s one of the most entertaining movies I\'ve seen all year, worthy of being seen on a massive theater.\nRating: A-'], ['-', 'Gal Gadot returns as Diana Prince in “Wonder Woman 1984” which has seen its release date shift a few times due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The film has started to open overseas and will arrive in the U.S. on Christmas day with a limited debut on HBO Max as well.\nThe story sees Diana now living in Washington D.C. in 1984. Diana is popular but has refused male companionship as she still longs for her late love Steve Trevor (Chris Pine).\nDiana works in the Smithsonian Institute in antiquities and keeps her secret identity under wraps even when a daring mall heist forces her to leap into action.\nA shy and passive employee named Barbara (Kirsten Wiig); who is afraid of her own shadow and largely ignored by her peers is befriended by Diana and they discover one item from the heist is inscribed with the ability to grant a wish. Unknowingly Diana wishes for Steve to return and Barbara wishes to be more like Diana which sets a chain of events into motion.\nA shady business man named Maxwell Lord (Perdro Pascal) has his site on obtaining the relic as he believes having the ability to grant wishes will allow him to save his failing business and give him the power he craves.\nWith such a promising setup; the film ultimately does not deliver on its premise and becomes bogged down in drawn out sequences with surprisingly little action and gaps in logic that defy even standards for a comic book film.\nThe first 90 minutes of the film has roughly 10-15 minutes of action tops and we are instead given lengthy scenes of Steve trying to find an 80s fashion look; flying over fireworks, and Maxwell trashing from one locale to another without much needed continuity.\nAn action scene involving a convoy chase through the desert seems very inspired by “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and ultimately does not deliver especially with such a long gape between the action sequences.\nThe final act does attempt to redeem the film as seeing Barbara transform into her new persona is interesting and Wiig does a very solid job with the role. This sadly is undermined with a single line of dialogue which takes away a big part of the transformation that audiences deserved to see.\nThere was also a sequence where Diana races down the streets and takes to flight with her Lasso and then discovers she can fly like Superman. Not only is this not in keeping with the character; but we see this extended fast moving sequence where she is clearly heading away from D.C. at great speed only to arrive at a destination with an item which had been established to be back at her home in D.C.  It is this sort of sloppiness that really detracts from the film. There is also the fact that Steve has to fly her around on a jet that even as a pilot he should not know how to fly as he has never flown a jet aircraft in his life.\nWhen the big confrontation comes it is a letdown as it is not overly epic and the CGI really does not seem to mesh.

Jenkins not only Directed but did the screenplay for it. Considering the amazing job she did writing “Monster” I had high expectations for the film but to me it seemed like it could have used a bit more attention to several aspects.\nMy summary would be the following… good cast, entertaining in parts, not much action over two hours, takes huge liberties with Diana and her abilities, massive gaps in logic even for a comic movie.

Lighter in action, but thematically profound, this may not be a film that pleases everyone.\nLet\'s start with the positives: Gal Gadot, as a wonder woman, continues to prove to be the perfect choice to play the part. The actress maintains a strong bond with the audience , really showing all the strong emotions that the character feels during the course of the story. Without her, the film would lose something really essential: her soul.\nThe story, thematically linked to greed, our deepest desires and selfishness, provides a journey of development for the characters that makes us reassess certain attitudes taken throughout our lives.  The story seeks to develop each of the characters, and this is what gives it so much strength.\nChris Pine, as Steve Trevor, is also one of the film\'s high points, and his chemistry with Gadot remains explosive, providing the film with an engaging romance that will make anyone feel warm inside.\nThe film is completely different from the first, its style is radically changed, becoming lighter, like a cartoon we watched on Saturday morning as children. For some, dramatic stylistic change may be a negative factor, but in a year of so much suffering, lightness and hope are exactly what we need to abstract ourselves from real life for two hours.\nWhen it comes to action, the film is not as explosive as first, it is contained and the action sequences, though incredible, are scarce. In a two and a half hour film, this may entice some to feel bored. But in my opinion, the film never slows down because of the incredible characters and their interactions.\nAs far as the most negative points of the film are concerned, I would say that the rope of suspension of credibility is really stretched during the duration of the film and we are asked to accept really ridiculous things that come out of nowhere. The film is also very cheesy, with sequences that can be considered lame and dull.\nAll in all, however, this film is a glimmer of hope and joy in a dark and desperate year. I strongly advise you to watch it, it\'s two hours of fun, with no problems and smiles in the mix.

Why would China have been left out of the turmoil affecting the rest of the world?  Were the makers of the film afraid to show anything negative about China, but were willing to show other nations in a type of stereotypical light?  The depiction of the President of the US, who in 1984 was actually Ronald Reagan, was shown to be an insecure and to be overly ready to shoot off the nuclear warheads.  They never called him by name, but the dark hair and the jar of jelly beans were obvious who they were portraying.  The hair of the villain of the movie and his ever growing quest for power were subtle clues for another person that Hollywood has deemed a power hungry demonic person.  Ironically, the villain uses the same medium to spread his mental suggestions as the media uses to influence us to theirs.

I do not expect an action and special effects movie to be realistic but there are some limits. Sawyer climbing around on the outside of the building (with one leg remember) in the updraft from 50 or so burning levels was just nonsense. Also, a building burning that much and that long and yet all the electrical wiring and plumbing still working was a bit too much. The absolutely worst offence though was how everyone magically survived sitting in the middle of the fire being extinguished by the release of halon gas (or some equivalent).

Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn’s latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that’s trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, “So what’s it going to be?” There’s also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we’ve already seen before in movies like “Romancing the Stone” (1984), “The Long Kiss Goodnight” (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it’s true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there’s a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there’s the picture’s excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. “Argylle” also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn’t quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what’s conveyed in the picture’s video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O’Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn’t nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. “Argylle” apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we’ll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces.

Surprisingly, Lin (director of two “Fast & Furious” flicks) shows some engaging and intriguing heft in Star Trek Beyond as the adventurous exploits of the USS Enterprise crew are likely to stir the collective pot where the nostalgic sentiments of the Star Trek brand from yesteryear bridges the gap to the current cinematic explosiveness of modern-day Captain Kirk and company. Although it is extremely difficult to immediately dismiss filmmaker J.J. Abrams’s resourceful fingerprints concerning the imaginative Star Trek (2009) and the thoroughly enjoyable Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) he graciously steps aside to allow Lin’s energizing directorial vision to further explore Trek mythology on the big screen.\nEssentially, Star Trek Beyond is a vibrant cosmic canvas that is expansive in its boundaries of exploration. Visually arresting, well-paced and armed with compelling story-telling and a healthy dosage of curiosity and mystery, Lin manages to stay true to the traditional Trek-oriented universe by incorporating rousing special effects and offering a galactic grandeur of planetary peculiarities and exotic alien races to stimulate the exquisite narrative. Screenwriters Doug Jung and Simon Pegg (Star Trek’s on-screen character Montgomery “Scotty” Scott) incorporate an eye-opening mixture of dramatic edginess, off-the-cuff humor and the cohesive rapport among the cast-mates that have inherited the iconic Star Trek personalities and made these familiar faces from the classic 60’s TV show and previous non-reboot films a revelation in the millennium age of blockbuster sci-fi action adventure.\nThe plot channels in a sense of challenging malaise for the USS Enterprise’s top officers in Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto). What seemingly spices things up regarding the deja vu space journeys aboard the spacecraft is the questionable and powerful device that Kirk and his crew are babysitting. This powerful tool of destruction is capable of destroying humanity as we know it. In particular, the opportunistic Krall (Idris Elba) is the lizard-looking culprit determined to get his diabolical hands on the corrosive contraption. Naturally, Krall and his menacing minions must subdue Kirk and his crew to achieve success in having this ominous object in his deadly grasp. Krall’s willingness to cripple the USS Enterprise proved to be an ambitious mission fully accomplished. For Kirk and his group the results were disheartening as Krall’s forceful attacks rendered the ship disabled as it crashed on the desolate planet of Altamid. Thus, Kirk and his charges are stranded on his rocky haven with no hope in sight. The harsh reality for the vulnerable USS Enterprise visitors, besides being divided and scattered in all directions on this problematic planet, involved getting into survival mode as the hostile reptilian creatures surrounded them at will.\nThe aforementioned split of Kirk and his exposed cohorts called for a series of various crisis carried on at different, chaotic spots. Kirk and Russian crew member Pavel Chekov (played by the late Anton Yelchin) were primarily tasked with trying to rescue their colleagues from the claws of Krall and his cronies. Elsewhere, Dr. Bones (Keith Urban) tries to patch up the injured Spock following the aftermath of the ship’s wrecking. Pegg’s Scotty and womanly warrior in alien Jayla (Sofia Boutella) make the valiant effort in trying to reach Kirk in the middle of total ribaldry.\nStar Trek Beyond has stylized flash and Lin ensures that his pulsating production stays faithful to the Trek legacy. Sure, Beyond is not anything innovative or wildly distinctive in comparison to the other earlier entries but it still thrives where it counts in the spectacle of space-aged escapism. The cast is solid as the players–Pine, Quinto, Pegg, Urban, Yelchin as well as Zoe Saldana’s Uhura and John Cho’s Sulu–all demonstrate a suspenseful unity on screen and give the audience an indescribable excitement in this latest chapter that far from disappoints. Elba’s Krall is robustly villainous in physicality and attitude and the alien race featured are interestingly hypnotic in creepiness. Lin, in the same vein as Abrams, is not shy about gift-wrapping his Star Trek edition in boisterous, sweeping helpings of scope and whimsy.\nOverall, this kinetic outing of Beyond practically guarantees that the rebooted Star Trek phenomenon will not be experiencing its final frontier any time soon.\nStar Trek Beyond (2016)\nParamount Pictures\n2 hrs.\nStarring: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Anton Yelchin, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Idris Elba, Sofia Boutella\nDirected by: Justin Lin\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\nGenre: Science Fiction/Space and Fantasy Saga/Action and Adventure\nCritic’s rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\n(c) Frank Ochieng (2016)'], ['-', ""I saw this movie two hours ago and I can't remember how it started.

I have seen many space adventure films, but I never felt this series so interesting. I enjoyed some of the 'Star Trek' films though. I know this sequel is not good the previous ones, but for me this look okay than those. Because it was so simple, particularly story wise, and the rest of the film was action and adventure.\nNo offense, but this series is like the collection of the rejections from other franchises. I mean, look at the cast, most of them are comedians and some of them are the category two actors and the rest are, I don't know what they are, bur decent actors. But these films pulled off successfully at the box office. Not a big impact like the recent 'Star Wars' film or any Marvel's films, but quite an impressive figure knowing the above fact I stated.\nFrom the Taiwanese director who made four 'Fast and Furious' films, handled his best for this. This film tells the story of the captain James Kirk, who leads his ship and crew to a rescue mission to a distant planet where some alien race who had stranded. But when they reach their destination, an unknown space army takes them by surprise and they too take a refuse on the same planet. From there how they plan to escape and to learn who were those attackers, all comes in the next half.\nThis id full of action adventure. The story was little, but quite neatly developed characters, I mean the new ones with some good stunt sequences. As usual, there's no complaint about the graphics. I mean for the casual viewing, but who knows if you carefully look for the flaws, you might get a few. I suggest you to watch it just for an entertainment, but it might fail to satisfy the die-hard fans of 'Star Trek'.

It was a fair enough impression, but it didn't fit with the rest of the reboot that seemed to care nothing about Star Trek.\nUltimately when Quinto channels Nimoy like that it just gives the viewer the jarring sensation that one member of the cast cared about what came before and forces the viewer to remember that this actually is a Star Trek film.\nAnd that doesn't work in a rebooted franchise that relies on nostalgia, in place of a story, and then kind of mocks the nostalgia.\nThat is ultimately the problem, Star Trek was a science-Fiction space adventure that was both cheesy and offered veiled social commentary about an idealistic world governed by a strict meritocracy with a strong morality and how that idealism clashes with other species and ideals by both forging alliances and making enemies.\nThis had nothing to do with that. It is basically an action movie with science-fiction elements and occasional nods to the cheesy fun that Star Trek once was. At it's core it didn't have the heart that lends itself to an engaging plot and character arcs.\nAnd, given that it came after a betrayal, that is after they rebooted one of the franchise's best films and took away most everything that made it so great and fun... I didn't care enough to actually see it until it came on television.\nThe real issue the reboot thing, for some reason they always take out plot and character development and fill that void with action and it makes the film feel visually appealing yet hallow.""], ['20%', 'Spock in a relationship with Uhura...\nGimme a break!!!']]"

I mean, who hasn’t seen this movie yet? If by some extraordinary circumstances you’re one of those unlucky souls, stop. Spend the next hour and a half watching this animated masterpiece and come back here. I will still avoid mentioning key details because I’m just used to it, and The Lion King has so many things to compliment that I don’t really need to get in-depth on spoilers. So, in case you haven’t notice it through my Twitter or occasional mentions in other reviews, The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time (animated or not)!\nI rewatched it for the 312358th time this last weekend, and I cried more than when I was just a child. That’s how much this movie means to me. The sense of nostalgia plus the overwhelming emotions throughout the runtime are tear-inducing aspects that I can’t simply avoid. I literally cried (waterfalls) in four (!) different scenes. The opening sequence (Circle of Life) filled my eyes with nostalgia’s tears. Mufasa’s tragic moment obviously wrecked me (one of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the history of cinema). Simba receiving the whole “remember who you are” speech from Mufasa in the clouds is incredibly inspirational and therefore worthy of some sobbing. Finally, one of the last scenes, Simba climbing his way to the top of Pride Rock with Hans Zimmer‘s score, leaving me absolutely destroyed.\nAnd I want to pick up on that last aspect: the score. It’s one of the most crucial technical features of a film, in my opinion. It can transform an “okay” scene into something magical or something pretty terrible, depending on what kind of score it is. Consequently, it can make a “good” movie turn into a “great” one. Hans Zimmer is one of my favorite composers ever. His soundtracks are always filled with such an epic vibe. Even if the film itself isn’t that good, his scores are still able to elevate it in some way. The Lion King is one of his most memorable scores due to how emotionally compelling it is, even in the subtlest moments.\nDuring the stampede sequence, the score doesn’t lend you time to breathe. Its high rhythm and continuously growing music keep any viewer at the edge of the seat, waiting for it to be over. Then, when Simba descends and approaches his dad, the score is so subtle. Completely opposite to the previous sumptuous and grand sound. It’s that nuance plus the impact of the scene itself that make me cry. In the last scene that I mentioned above, it’s solely the score that brings in the chill-inducing tears. If Simba climbed Pride Rock with no soundtrack, it would just be a good ending. However, from the exact moment that the score fades in, it instantly turns that sequence into an epic finale. The slow-motion walk to the top, the immersive score, Simba’s roar … Damn it, I’m crying again!\nThe animation is some of Disney’s best. It’s not by chance that the Disney Renaissance Era (1989-1999), which was the return to form by Disney, has the best animation quality of its history, and a lot of the memorable movies that marked everyone’s childhood. Its expressiveness and ease to make animals emote elevates the story and its characters. There’s no need for any kind of dialogue when you can see how the characters are reacting and understand what they’re feeling. The wide shots are beautiful to look at and worthy of being anyone’s wallpaper even today.\nThe songs are remarkable and they influenced an entire generation. Can You Feel the Love Tonight, Circle of Life, Be Prepared, Hakuna Matata, … Every single song is someone’s favorite. The voice work is perfect. James Earl Jones gives such an outstanding vocal performance that even when discussing his career’s biggest role, Darth Vader isn’t the obvious choice. Jeremy Irons and his raspy voice elevate Scar as the villainous character. If you close your eyes and only hear every character’s voice, without having watched the film previously, you can easily identify who’s the “bad guy”, and that’s unbelievably good. Everyone else is amazing, but these two gentlemen are astonishing, and they deserve to be remembered forever as the voices of these iconic roles.\nNevertheless, in the end, the two pillars of every movie always matter the most: story and characters. The Lion King has an especially compelling screenplay, one that teaches its viewers how to handle loss, but also how to grow up and overcome our worst fears. It’s true that most people cry watching this film, but those same people are filled with joy by the end because they accompanied Simba’s journey. From being a reckless and innocent cub to becoming the king that everyone needed, while also making his father extremely proud. Even though it’s a very tragic movie, Timon and Pumbaa are two hilarious characters that keep bringing some sense of happiness by delivering some well-needed laughs. Their laid-back lifestyle is something that everyone desires, but when you have responsibilities, you can’t just hide from them. You must learn how to be what everyone needs you to be, without losing the essence of who you are.\nIt’s a masterpiece! It doesn’t matter if it’s an animated film. It doesn’t matter if it was “made for kids”. People need to stop looking at animated flicks as something juvenile that only children can watch while parents can do something else. If parents watched this kind of inspirational animated movies as well, maybe the world would be a better place. The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time, and it’s undeniably one of Disney’s best original movies. From the gorgeous animation to the beautiful score, from the emotionally compelling story to the life journey Simba goes through, from the chill-inducing tearful moments to the loud laughs … The Lion King is just perfect. Hopefully, its “live-action” remake will keep its essence and deliver these feelings once again.\nRating: A+'], ['70%', 'Certainly not one of Disney\'s better animations from a technical perspective - the artwork lacks the vibrancy and detail of many of their earlier stories; but the combined efforts of Sir Tim Rice, Elton John and Hans Zimmer make this an enjoyable fantasy adventure.

That idyllic existence is not to last long, however - ""Nala"" discovers he is still alive and races to alert him of the disaster that has befallen the kingdom under the rule of his uncle and his trusty band of hyenas.

In a diversely multicultural version of 1980s New York (some might more correctly call it a multi-species zootropolis), Dog is a lonely soul.

The picture’s charming, imaginative animation presents a whimsical, nuanced view of the Big Apple in the late 20th Century with virtually no dialogue but backed with a killer soundtrack. The narrative, based on a graphic novel by Sara Varon, is a bit sluggish at times (especially in the film’s opening half) with some sequences that could have been trimmed or eliminated. In fact, some have contended that “Robot Dreams” is a glorified short that’s been needlessly padded to stretch out its runtime, though that’s a view I don’t share, despite my belief that this release would have benefitted from some judicious editing. As a general rule, I’m not an overly huge fan of animation, since much of it in my mind is excessively silly, manic and inane (especially among American productions), so I tend to pick what I screen in this genre very selectively. However, when animation works well, its offerings frequently turn my head, as this one often does.

This was the movie that made me start to dislike the character of Tony Stark/Iron Man (RDJ is still the man though).  Stark's narcissism had charm in the previous films but here, it made him into a complete idiot, dick, and coward. The Mandarin had potential to be an effective villain but the movie scraps him for a more lame villain than Justin Hammer from Iron Man 2.  The comedy was forced and annoying and the story has plot holes that were distracting.

Sure Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark is quite funny (not always but a lot of the time) and there are plenty of nice special effects and things being blown up.\nHowever, the story is just crap. The premise of Killian using the Mandarin for terrorism to cover up the fact that his experiments occasionally fails is just ludicrous. The Mandarin himself is a joke and another good example of how ignorant script writers just pick names out of existing material and uses them not caring how much they screw up established characters and world building already done. Whoever wrote this script should be ashamed of himself.\nWhat is worse, the entire movie is very anti-Iron-Man. It starts right of with Stark being obsessed by his Iron Man suits and a lot of harping about him stopping being Iron Man. Most of the time Stark is running around without his suit and the few times he is in it then the suit does not work properly or is shot off him almost immediately. Actually, most of Stark’s cool stuff is just shot to hell most of the time.\nThe end is full of fireworks but again, it is mostly a display in how you can destroy Iron Man suits and some more anti-Iron-Man crap.\nI cannot say that I did not enjoy watching the fireworks and special effects but as a whole I am disappointed with this movie.'], ['70%', 'A long form review originally posted in 2013\nIron Man 3 brings us into the so called “Phase 2” of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But it does so in a flawed way. I’ve said it before and reiterate it here, there is no such thing as a perfect film. But since The Avengers set the bar so very high, following that up proved to simply be too much for Black’s entry to handle.\nThere are a great deal of inconstancies, plot holes, stupid moves, illogical choices, and weak moments (though less than much of the internet would have you believe). These issues are not enough to lead to Iron Man 3’s complete and utter downfall, but they do force a sour taste into the piece overall.\nThis isn’t to say it’s a bad movie though. In fact it’s actually quite good. It surpasses the quality of Iron Man 2 and plants itself firmly in the MCU rather successfully. A move which only The Incredible Hulk failed to make, but still. Yes it has its problems, yes we’d hoped for better, and yes I’ve got complaints, but the movie is not at all a failure. Manages to come full circle in a way that still leaves Tony Stark & Iron Man a future in the Marvel Universe.\nShane Black and Drew Pearce manage to bring in a sense of vulnerability that was barely touched on in the past MCU works. Even the minuscule Steve Rogers of Captain America seemed in control of every situation. But here we see Tony Stark as not only a breakable man, but a man in general. The most human of any Super Hero appearance in the MCU to date. Yes the Robert Downey Jr. wit that all have come to expect from the piece is still on the table, but in between and beneath that there’s an insomniac with extreme anxiety disorders living separated from the real world, too invested in his work and shattered identity to live as the Stark everyone expects him to still be.\nPepper and Rhodey are even given a chance to pick up the slack. The three form this sort of protagonist trinity, Saving one another in a round-robin Super Hero-y way with a little more depth than I’d expected.\nThe Iron Man movies famously have had the most disappointing bad-guy-show-downs in the genre. And though here Black gives us much more of a delivery on this front than Favreau ever did, the issues I had with Iron Man 3 came (almost) exclusively from A.I.M, the Mandarin and Extremis (which form the antagonist trinity now that I think of it).\nSo, we’ve got better a better final confrontation, but from less integral bad guys. A more human hero, stuck in a less human adventure. A better interlocking of characters, with less to do on screen. I could go on with this roller coaster, but that word essentially sums up the film. Not in that its a cliched “thrill ride”, but in that it’s a constant mess of ups and downs, with the final destination just barely justifying the start point.\nSpeaking non-comparitively, Iron Man 3 makes a good movie. Not great. But so very, very worth the watch. It’s hard for me to think objectively separate from the other films in the MCU, because I’ve seen them all so many times that there’s no way for me to forget all that’s come before when watching the movie. I’d be interested to hear from somebody who’s watched Iron Man 3, but not Iron Man 1 & 2 or The Avengers. I’m sure such a person exists somewhere, and if so your input would be greatly appreciated.\nI think I might have made it seem as if I disliked Iron Man 3 more than I actually did. Here’s why. From Iron Man 2 until The Avengers, I watched all the MCU films in cinemas. After each one, I immediately got that feeling of wanting to go back and watch it again, a feeling that steadily grew as time passed. Each film that Marvel released had me feeling this more strongly than the last, culminating in The Avengers which I saw six times in theatres, and immediately pre-ordered the whole set on Blu-Ray the moment it became available (I bought a PS3 for the sole purpose of watching them). But with Iron Man 3 I sort of dropped back to a pretty low interest level once I’d left Hoyts. It seemed that although it was a really good watch, it just didn’t have the staying power I’d come to expect from these incredible Super Hero films.\n67%\n-Gimly'], ['80%', ""I don't understand the hate for this one.

(Advanced Idea Mechanics), led by Killian (Guy Pearce). After Stark\'s personal world is destroyed, he is left to survive by relying on his ingenuity and instincts to rise from the ashes and protect those closest to him, like Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). In the process Tony seeks to answer a question that has haunted him: Does the suit of armor make the man or does the man make the suit of armor? Don Cheadle and Jon Favreau are on hand as James Rhodes (War Machine) and Happy Hogan respectively while Rebecca Hall plays an agent of A.I.M.\nAfter the absolutely kinetic (and inexplicably criticized) ""Iron Man 2"" this third part of the trilogy is a bit of a letdown.

For instance, Pepper morphs into a veritable superheroine at one point. Nevertheless, it\'s not bad at all and the cast is great with Rebecca Hall and Guy Pearce effective in their roles.\nThe movie runs 130 minutes and was shot North Carolina, Southern California and Miami.\nGRADE: C+'], ['50%', ""It's a substantially weaker film than its two predecessors.\nAfter two frankly good films, I was curious to see what this film would bring to the public, who immediately set out to fill the studio's coffers with their tickets money. Marvel has discovered an excellent financial lode by transposing most of its characters to the cinema, and this film is destined to be a box office success, although the quality is much more questionable.\nI'll start with what I usually leave for last: the technical aspects and production values \u200b\u200bare really excellent and constitute the strongest and most solid point of the film. Directed by Jon Favreau, who has held his chair since the first “Iron Man”, the film has retained most of the crew and core cast, which helps give the trilogy the flavor of a unique work. With a solid bet on more flashy, loud and spectacular action, the film wants to appeal to a young audience that wants something big, where CGI and effects can create authenticity and a sense of danger. The quality of the effects is undeniable, but the excessive action takes a toll on the final set. It looks like a video game, a recurring mistake in these types of movies.\nIn addition, the film has good cinematography, it was beautifully shot, it is sharp, and it has excellent colors and light. The work of the stuntmen is meritorious, yet regularly forgotten in the minds of viewers. The sets and costumes are very good, especially Tony Stark's house and the various armors from the movie. Another word for the soundtrack, by Dwight Yoakim, which proved to be up to the task without, however, proving to be memorable.\nThe cast includes most of the names we already know from the previous two films, with Robert Downey Jr. the most relevant for maintaining the leading role. The actor is good, deserves our credit, and I recognize that he tried to give his character a greater maturity and sense of experience. In this film, Stark is a much more mature, traumatized, tired and even fragile man, and his relationship with Pots has become more formal and firm, causing the former playboy to settle down and carry on a serious love relationship. I understand that this may displease some, but the film seems to take place several years after its predecessor, “Iron Man 2”, and makes mention of several events, in the meantime. With excellent technical work and the use of excellent makeup artists, Ben Kingsley shone in the role he was given and which is clearly one of the best of his recent career. Paltrow and Cheadle also leave us a positive record of his work, although it wasn't as intense as one would expect. Favreau, in addition to directing the film, has a brief funny cameo as Happy. But it's Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall we should be worried about: they do what they can, and yet the film didn't give them much of a chance to do more and better.\nThe biggest problem with this movie is, of course, the plot and writing of the script, dialogues and scenes. Attempts at comedy are very unpleasant, and Stark, who once had almost a barrage of phrases and jokes for all occasions, is now a serious and weary man. The material given to the actors is scarce and does not bring anything really good. In addition, the film has almost no connection with the previous films, and especially “Iron Man 2”, whose events are never really spoken by anyone.""], ['70%', ""While the deeper dive into Tony Stark and his past is welcomed, the execution came up a little short compared to Iron Man’s MCU entries.\nIron Man 3 might be my least favorite of the Iron Man franchise, but it's still a great movie. Iron Man 3 focuses much more on Tony Stark and his trauma following The Avengers rather than on Iron Man and the suit. A large portion of the film and even some action scenes explore who Stark is without the high-tech suit or fancy technology in general. Stark grapples with the fallout of past decisions and has to decide who he is at his core without the money or Iron Man. As expected, the entire cast dazzles in their performances, from Robert Downey Jr. To Don Cheadle to Gwyneth Paltrow, but the true standout is Ben Kingsley's Mandarin. Iron Man 3 is all about Stark's growth and development, and while that's a great idea, its poor villain and lack of actual Iron Man leave the film feeling a little hollow. I still appreciated the movie and its Christmas cheer, but the MCU has far better Iron Man movies and moments to enjoy.""]]"

Of the new arrivals it\'s Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody (Brendan Gleeson terrific) who is most telling and enjoyable, but tabloid scribe Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson) is something the film could have survived without. Yes it\'s a nice pop at the gutter press, but watching it now, would the time spent wasted on Skeeter not have been better served on the sadly under filmed Quidditch World Cup? Especially considering the build up to it is magnificent. Or at the very least some more Malfoy Senior, Sirius or Snape! But the disappointment felt there is offset some by the wonderful Yule Ball, where Newell is in his element gleefully dangling his charges through the joys and sorrows of awkward awakenings. It\'s a series highlight that\'s not to be missed.\nA film of variable pace due to the makers trying to juggle so much, it\'s ultimately something of an up and down viewing experience. That said, Newell is able to dazzle the pre-teens with his set pieces, because the kiddies sure as hell will not understand the angst and hormonal issues present, while the rest plays out on adult terms. So something for everyone, then. It may not be successful as a whole, and newcomers dipping in for the first time get no guidance at all, but it\'s still a ripper of a ride for those who are into the films having not read the books. It\'s set up nicely for part 5, but pity poor David Yates in the directing chair for Order of the Phoenix, though, for that is one hell of a door stopper novel to try and condense down into an entertaining Potter movie! 7/10'], ['90%', ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is an absolute spectacle. I am a huge sucker for tournaments in films and this hit every single note for me; intensity, stakes, creativity, it is all there.\nOur main cast is doing some of the best acting of the series, Daniel Radcliffe really raises his performance up a notch and establishes himself as the lead of the franchise. His acting is refined and mature and he does an excellent job portraying his emotions with not only his line delivery but his facial expressions and body language. He really broke through here and it was a joy to see. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were great, but they had a slight decrease in screentime and really were sidelined during this film. The introduction of Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory brings an interesting dynamic to the story, as Harry Potter has somewhat of an older brother figure to contend with. The relationship and chemistry between the two builds and brings some emotionally heavy scenes throughout.\nThere is constant action in this film; from the opening scenes of the Quidditch World Cup to the multiple rounds of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, there is always something happening, and it helps create a very steady pace throughout. Not only is there action, but there is also fantastic character development. All of our characters really start to come into their own through the struggles they all face throughout the film. Harry is the best he's ever been, and the new faces are great on screen. Alastor Moody is mysterious and quirky and is a great mentor to Harry.\nBut the greatest thing about this film is the sinster introduction of Lord Voldemort. His presence was lurking in the background of the entire series, but here he is reborn in a horrifying way. Ralph Feinnes is superb in his only 6 minutes of screen time, but it is enough to leave a lasting impression. The ending is perfect and sets the tone of the franchise going forward.\nWhile the cinematography and tone might be better in Prisoner of Azkaban, I cannot deny that this movie is better in almost every other aspect, which is why it gets a slight nod.\nScore: 89% | \nVerdict: Excellent""]]"

The team includes a tough mercenary (Michael Madsen), an anthropologist (Alfred Molina), a molecular biologist (Marg Helgenberger) and an empath (Forest Whitaker).\nI developed a bad attitude toward ""Species"" for years due to Roger Ebert\'s scathing review, but changed my mind upon giving it an openminded viewing. This is a top-of-the-line sci-fi/adventure/horror flick. People look down on it because of the nudity and mild sex scenes, which prompts them to disdain it as exploitive and trashy. While Natasha Henstridge is a good-lookin\' woman, she doesn\'t do anything for me (she\'s not my type) so I was able to totally overlook this element and focus on the film\'s other attributes.\nFor one, the score by Christopher Young is excellent. Secondly, the A-list cast is a highlight and their characters are increasingly fleshed-out in the story. Lastly, while people understandably write-off the movie as a Grade B plot with Grade A production, there\'s more here than meets the eye. For instance, Sil is the innocent pawn of the extraterrestrials who sent the DNA. Another example is the excellent character of Dan (Whitaker) whom whiners complain about as ""always pointing out the obvious"" when the movie shows over and over that he DOES know things the others don\'t and they ignore him to their own peril. Dan is necessary so that the team knows what direction the creature takes on repeated occasions; without Dan we\'d see them pursue one boring dead-end after another.\nWhile snobby film critics love to hate ""Species"" it\'s a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi adventure with an interesting moral and a great cast of characters.

It may not be as good as ""Aliens,"" ""Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2,"" but it\'s on par with ""Alien"" (and marginally better IMHO) and superior to ""Predator.""

For three years in a row, Peter Jackson has banished our winter blues with the individual instalments of his Tolkien trilogy, effectively shifting the focus of our cinematic excitement from the summer months to the end of the year. But now that his epic has been unveiled in its entirety, what will be the lasting effects of his achievement?\nWell, grand-scale fantasy filmmaking is back on the menu, laying down the gauntlet to George Lucas and Star Wars Episode III. Jackson has also proved that notions of risk and ambition needn't be confined to the low-budget, indie end of the spectrum; nor does California have an exclusive stranglehold on groundbreaking special effects.\nAnd then there's the DVD factor. Just as The Lord Of The Rings was upping the stakes in theatres, so too was its DVD release pattern defining what can (and should) be done on disc for major movies.\nIn particular, the four-disc extended editions seem to have affected the director's thinking as to what he can get away with in his theatrical final cut. Hence the public grumbles from Christopher Lee about the non-appearance of Saruman in this final instalment. While it might have been fair to grant Lee a curtain call, Jackson quite rightly realises that it is Sauron, not Saruman, whose fiery eye encompasses all the narrative strands of the climax.\nThe Return Of The King marks the first time in the series when Jackson's roots as a horror filmmaker creep through. As the orcs catapult severed Gondorian heads beyond the walls of Minas Tirith, flesh-rotted ghosts draw swords alongside Aragorn and giant spider Shelob stalks Frodo through dark, web-shrouded tunnels, the film pushes the boundaries of its 12A certificate.\nAnd so it should, because the look and tone must necessarily grow darker as the Hobbits near Mount Doom and Mordor's evil hand grips Middle-earth ever tighter.\nCharacter nuances have been crafted over an unprecedented ten hours-plus of cinematic storytelling: from Strider lurking in the shadowy corner to Aragorn rallying the troops; from Merry and Pippin as bumbling fools to stout-hearted, pint-sized warriors. Only Legolas and Gimli seem to have regressed (in screen time at least) to set-piece archer and comedy sidekick respectively. At least Andy Serkis is rewarded for his Gollum voice work with an early flashback that gets his face on screen, as well as warning us that, under the ring's power, Smeagol can be as murderous as Gollum.\nJackson has kept the momentum of the series rolling on and on though the traditionally 'difficult' middle part and 'weak' finale, delivering a climax to the story that's neater and more affecting than what Tolkien managed on the printed page. Some viewers might feel that the director sprinkles some cheese on his extended coda, adding at least one false ending too many (even if he does ignore the book's Scouring of The Shire).\nBut those who have walked beside these heroes every step of the way on such a long journey deserve the emotional pay-off as well as the action peaks, and they will be genuinely touched as the final credits roll. Yes, the Ring is dead. Long live King Kong.\nVerdict - The resounding climax to a landmark in cinema history. But the King has now returned, the story is over and the ships are leaving Middle-earth. Ladies and gentlemen, Elvish has left the building.\n5/5""], ['50%', ""Too much CGI, redundancy, clichés and drawn out “looks of love” for my tastes.\nRELEASED 2003 and directed by Peter Jackson, “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” adapts the third part of JRR Tolkien’s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth: Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) continue to try to make their way to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Meanwhile Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom), Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies), Gandalf the wizard (Ian McKellen), King Theoden (Bernard Hill) and Faramir (David Wenham) join forces to fight Sauron's army at the stone city of Minas Tirith and, later, draw the forces of Modor out as a distraction for Frodo to accomplish his goal. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are on hand as Hobbits Pippin and Merry.\nWhile I’m a casual fantasy/adventure fan and have read numerous books of the genre (e.g. Conan, Tarzan, Gor, etc.), I’ve never read Tokien, likely because I’m not into Hobbits, Elves and Dwarfs. After viewing the three movies, The Lord of the Rings strikes me as a mixture of Robin Hood, Conan and The Wizard of Oz, which all possibly influenced Tolkien’s writing of the Rings trilogy in 1937-1949. So, if you think a meshing of “Conan the Barbarian” (1982) and “Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves” (1991) with “The Wizard of Oz” (1939) sounds good, then you’ll probably like these movies more than me.\n“The Return of the King” is just more of the same showcased in the first two movies, but even LONGER. Take the Battle of Minas Tirith, for example. It’s basically the same as The Battle at Helms Deep in the previous movie, except with colossal elephant-like creatures and the Army of the Dead. These two battles are similar enough that they could’ve been condensed into one conflict. Speaking of the Army of the Dead, this was an interesting new element, as was the horrifying spider-monster that Frodo & Sam face inside the caves.\nLike the first two movies, the characters are diverse, the tale is creative, there’s a lot of dark action rounded out by softer scenes and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS magnificent. Unfortunately, as with “The Two Towers,” there’s excessive use of CGI (aka CGI porn). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you’ll likely appreciate this installment more than me.\nThere are other problems: While the characters are inspired, they’re also thin and rather uninteresting, at least for mature people who require more depth to hold their attention. Take Legolas (Bloom), for example; we never get to know him. Or consider Aragorn: Mortensen is perfect as the noble warrior, but in the ENTIRE trilogy he probably only has like two full pages of dialog, maybe three. Also, I found the story generally disengaging. I was never much enthralled by the characters and their pursuits, although devotees of Tolkien might be.\nThen there are WAY too many “looks of love” between characters, particularly Frodo and Sam (I was so happy to see one character get married and have kids, if you catch my drift). There’s also a sense of redundancy, like the aforementioned battles (Helms Deep and Minas Tirith). Or consider the hokey dangling from a cliff by one’s fingers: This was already done with Gandalf at the end of the first part and beginning of the next. Did we really need the entire trilogy to come down to this type of eye-rolling cliché?\nAnother problem is the lack of feminine protagonists. There’s Miranda Otto as Éowyn, Théoden's niece, who becomes infatuated with Aragorn and masquerades as a warrior-ess. Other than that all we have are cameos by Liv Tyler (Arwen), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) and a Hobbit’s wife. “Mythica: A Quest for Heroes” (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the creators knew enough to throw in a couple of prominent babes as heroines in the story. So did “Conan the Barbarian” and “Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God” (2005). It’s not rocket science.\nAs noted above, the movie’s needlessly overlong and things could’ve been condensed in the trilogy or omitted altogether. When the main storyline ultimately ends at Mount Doom I was thinking there was maybe 12-15 minutes left with half of that time being credits. Nope, there was STILL 30 MINUTES LEFT wherein boring goodbyes and “looks of love” are tacked on.\nDespite these honest quibbles, “The Return of the King,” and the trilogy in general, was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, particularly those who favor Tolkien, Hobbits, Elves, Gnomes and the like.\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 3 hours 21 minutes and was shot in New Zealand.\nGRADE: C""], ['100%', ""Great finale to a great trilogy.

Now, mind you, I am not your usual, ""The book is better"" movie reviewer.  But it is almost like Peter Jackson went out of his way to take out the most crucial elements of the books and replace it with drivel.  Also every line that sounds even remotely cool in the books must be given to Gandalf, no matter who actually said it...  That\'s just frustrating, despite Sir Ian McKellen\'s stellar performance.  With what I would hope is the obvious exception of Orlando Bloom\'s third dismal performance as Legolas, the actors all did quite well; the characters were just not allowed to shine as they do in the books.\nI see that the common consensus is that this movie is too long, and I agree.  What\'s most frustrating about that to me is that this movie had to finish The Two Towers since that film did not complete, and then this film left out the pivotal ending of the saga.  The Return of the King is actually the shortest volume of the three (there are six books, two in each volume).  As some have noted, the film noticeably scraps the scouring of the Shire, but for those who might have hoped for a fourth installment to finish that story, Peter Jackson dashed all hopes by disturbingly killing off Saruman at the beginning of the extended edition.  By the by, I understand many people feel that the scouring of the Shire is anticlimactic after the final defeat of Sauron, but for myself, I think the point that there is still evil in the world, and that heroes must still rise to fight it, is one of Tolkien\'s triumphs.  Back to my main point, though: the books were shorter while telling more story, because despite his depth and detail, Tolkien understood how to drive  a story along.  Peter Jackson, on the other hand, fails on that count.\nAnyway, I am someone who always hoped that these movies would be made (I grew up watching the animations produced by Rankin/Bass and Fantasy Films).  But now I suppose I\'ll have to wait until someone is daring enough to try again, despite the overwhelming success of these films (which will probably not happen in my lifetime).

The battle scenes are superb, though - when we get them, the effects really do rise to the occasion and, of course, the striking cinematography coupled with the inspired themes from Howard Shore contribute to a thoroughly entertaining adaptation of a thoroughly captivating fantasy adventure. If you make it past the start of the credits, there is the gloriously haunting ""Into the West"" from Annie Lennox to top off this finest of trilogies.

Avildsen. After Rocky Balboa did the seemingly impossible, redeeming and concluding the franchise after the damage done by Rocky V, Creed, written by Coogler and Aaron Covington, and directed by Coogler, did something even more unlikely – revitalising the franchise with Rocky himself as a supporting character. For the sequel, Stallone is back as a writer (sharing credit with Juel Taylor, from a story by Sascha Penn and Cheo Hodari Coker), with Steven Caple Jr. directing (Coogler is credited as an executive producer). Whereas Creed was essentially a remake of the original Rocky, Creed II is more of a combination of Rocky III and Rocky IV, with some elements from Rocky II, and whilst it hits all the beats one expects from a Rocky movie, the problem is that it hits them so slavishly, and does little else. It also, perhaps inevitably, suffers badly in comparison to its predecessor, especially in terms of direction – whereas Coogler\'s directorial work was assured, distinctive, and inventive, Caple Jr.\'s is pedestrian and functional. Had it strayed from the formula just a tad, the way Creed did, the way Rocky Balboa did, it would have been a much better film instead of a bland rehash of something we\'ve seen multiple times (and not just in this franchise, but in virtually every boxing movie). The kernel for a terrific film is there, but the execution is not, it features a litany of clichés, it\'s dull, repetitive, the antagonist\'s subplot is infinitely more compelling than the main plot, and the culminating fight is almost parodic in design.\nIn Rocky IV, former WBC Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) was killed in the ring during an exhibition bout against Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). Determined to avenge the loss of his best friend, reigning champion Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) travelled to Moscow, where he not only defeated Drago, he also got the Soviet crowd on his side. 33 years later, Ivan\'s son, Viktor (the man-mountain that is Florian Munteanu), is training as a professional boxer in Ukraine, under the watchful eye of promoter Buddy Marcelle (Russell Hornsby). Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, three years after his professional debut against ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew), Apollo\'s son, Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan), is preparing for a bout against the champion, Danny ""Stuntman"" Wheeler (Andre Ward). Upon winning the title, Adonis proposes to his girlfriend, Bianca Taylor (Tessa Thompson), who says yes. Life seems perfect. That is until Viktor and Ivan head to the US and issue a very public challenge to Adonis. Meanwhile, Ivan tells Rocky, who is in Adonis\'s corner, that the fight is a way to regain honour for the Drago name, explaining that after their bout 33 years ago, he lost everything, including his wife, Ludmilla (Brigitte Nielsen), who left him shortly after Viktor\'s birth. Spurred on by Marcelle, and seeing an opportunity to avenge his father\'s death, Adonis plans to take the fight, but is warned against doing so by Rocky. When Adonis insists, Rocky says he can no longer train him. Adonis and Bianca move to Los Angeles so she can pursue her singing career, moving into a luxury apartment near Apollo\'s widow, Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashād). To replace Rocky, Adonis recruits Tony ""Little Duke"" Evers (Wood Harris), Wheeler\'s former trainer, and son of Tony ""Duke"" Evers (Tony Burton), who trained both Apollo and Rocky in the past. Feeling betrayed by Rocky, and finding it difficult to adjust to the recent changes in his life, including the fact that Bianca is pregnant, Adonis\'s preparations for the bout are not what they should be, whilst Ivan makes sure to push Viktor as hard as he possibly can.\nWhat\'s perhaps most surprising about Creed II is that not only is it a sequel to Creed, it\'s also a sequel to one of the most ridiculous films of all time, and one which certainly didn\'t cry out for a continuation of the narrative, Rocky IV. Creed recast the Rocky template for a modern audience, setting it in a social-realist African-American milieu and relegating Rocky to a supporting player. Rocky IV, by contrast, was the movie wherein the franchise abandoned all semblance of realism; the film in which Rocky himself, the working-class everyman, became a superhero (he even had a talking robot sidekick), travelling to the Soviet Union, defeating Communism, and winning the Cold War by preaching glasnost to the Soviet people (two years before Ronald Reagan\'s ""tear down this wall"" speech). It\'s a movie so ridiculous that the poster quite literally tells you how it ends! It also features Sylvester Stallone all but sexually abusing Sergei Eisenstein\'s theories of montage. The first example of such (Rocky driving pensively into the night) is a montage of Rocky thinking about montages, and the second (Rocky training by cutting down trees and running atop mountains) is probably the most 80s thing to ever exist. The film is, in fact, so preposterous, far-fetched, and ludicrous that if you\'re unable to have fun watching it, you may as well just stop watching movies.\nFrom an aesthetic point of view, Creed II is largely unremarkable (there\'s certainly nothing as epic as the single-shot fight from the first film), but one aspect that did stand out is the sound. As the first film established, Bianca is losing her hearing, something which is manifested in the aural design of Creed II several times. At the start of the film, for example, as Bianca walks through the backstage area prior to the title fight, the sound of the crowd is soft and distanced until she puts in her hearing aid. Later, when Creed is training in a swimming pool, Bianca and Mary Anne are talking at another location, with their conversation carrying over his scenes. However, every time he goes below the water, the sound of their voices dulls as if it were diegetic. When Adonis is knocked down during his bout with Viktor, all sound is pulled from the film, only returning when he locks eyes with Bianca in the crowd. Even Adonis\'s marriage proposal involves her hearing aid. This is all thematic, of course, insofar as they are worried their child may inherit her hereditary hearing loss.\nThematically, legacy is a huge issue in Creed II, particularly as it relates to fathers and sons – Apollo and Adonis, Ivan and Viktor, Duke and Little Duke. Rocky himself is something of a surrogate father to Adonis, and is estranged from his own son, Robert (Milo Ventimiglia, who played the role in Rocky Balboa), and a grandson he has never met. Whilst Creed saw Adonis use boxing as a way to symbolically bond with a father he never knew, Creed II is more concerned with the emotionally fraught terrain that can result when fathers try to live vicariously through their sons, and when sons must live with their father\'s failures. Everything Viktor does, for example, is an attempt to earn Ivan\'s approval, whilst Ivan sees Viktor as the only way to atone for what happened to him after losing to Rocky.\nIndeed, the depiction of the Dragos in general is especially interesting, and is both one of the best aspects of the film, and simultaneously one of the most problematic. In Rocky IV, Ivan was a cartoon villain, a badly written, pseudo-xenophobic hyperbole of what some Americans seemed to think Soviets were like. He was barely one-dimensional. In Creed II, he\'s still relatively thin as a character, but Lundgren is given enough room to portray him as essentially broken, living on nothing but bitterness, resentment, and shame. When he meets up with Rocky in the latter\'s restaurant, promising, ""my son will break your boy"", he comes across as more pathetic than anything else, a million miles from the almost automaton-like warrior of three decades prior. When Ivan mentions their fight, Rocky tries to dismiss it, ""that\'s like a million years ago."" Ivan, however, replies, ""but just yesterday to me."" One gets the impression that from the moment of his loss he\'s been waiting for this, seeing his son as nothing more than the delivery method of his vengeance. Ivan has raised Viktor in pure hate, teaching him that the only thing that matters is winning, but you can see in every move that Viktor is far more concerned with earning his father\'s respect – winning as an end unto itself means relatively little to him. There\'s a lot of pathos in that, and both Lundgren and Munteanu act the hell out of the complex dynamic. Working with Stallone for the fifth time, Lundgren\'s understated and subtle performance is easily the best of his career, and the best in the film, with the quietness that spoke to lack of interiority in the previous film, here suggesting a deeply felt pain.\nThe training montages also do something very interesting in respect to Viktor. Showing him jogging through economically impoverished communities, stacking crates, lugging around bags of cement, and working with less than state-of-the-art equipment, the parallel is not to Ivan, who trained with hi-tech gizmos and gadgets in Rocky IV, but to Rocky\'s training in the original film. Indeed, whilst Adonis lives in a luxury apartment, Viktor and Ivan live in a dingy bedsit in Ukraine that recalls Rocky\'s original digs in Philadelphia.\nThe problem with all of this is that the Dragos\' story is by far the most compelling one in the film. One should not come away from a film named Creed II wishing there had been less Creed and more of the antagonists. Although Creed, Bianca, and Rocky all get a little character development, the most interesting story arc is that of Ivan. Set against the complex and fascinating Drago family drama, Creed and Bianca\'s story is pretty insipid, and is essentially a rehash of Rocky\'s relationship with Adrian (Talia Shire) in Rocky II. The most dramatic and heartfelt moments of the film involve Ivan and Viktor, and the long middle section where Creed falls into a depression seems to go on forever; the whole time we were watching him fall apart, I was yearning to get back to the Dragos.\nAnd this feeds into the film\'s most egregious problems – its rigid adhesion to the Rocky template, and the concomitant predictability. Chances are that everything you think might happen in Creed II does, as the film makes no attempt whatsoever to be original. Aside from the Drago subplot, there is nothing here that we haven\'t seen before. Granted, the Rocky franchise has always tended to wear its predictability like a badge of honour, and the core template does undoubtedly work. But even when a film adheres to that template, one shouldn\'t be able to predict each narrative beat with near perfect accuracy. Even Rocky V, as awful as it was, tried something new, culminating with a street fight rather than an in-ring bout. It didn\'t even remotely work, but the thinking behind it was admirable. Aside from two unexpected cameos, Creed II never once caught me off-guard, doing nothing original, unexpected, or in any way daring. And because of that, for large portions of the runtime, particularly the middle section, the film is interminably boring.\nEven the boxing itself is not especially well-done. The cinematography by Kramer Morgenthau (Thor: The Dark World; Chef; Terminator Genisys) is fine, but nothing special, and pales in comparison to Maryse Alberti\'s work in the first film. Similarly, Caple Jr.\'s direction is efficient, but not in the same ballpark as Coogler\'s. Aside from Martin Scorsese\'s Raging Bull (1980) and Michael Mann\'s Ali (2001), both visually unique in their own ways, Creed is arguably the most technically proficient boxing movie in terms of in-ring competition. Creed II, however, shoots all the fights very conventionally, holding a fairly uniform three-quarters distance from the actors, with Caple Jr.\'s only trick seeming to be slow-motion, which he grossly over-uses. This has the effect of making the fights seem repetitive, even when the story being told by the fighting action is different (which isn\'t helped by the fact that Ivan tells Viktor to ""break him"" about 150 times).\nWhile we\'re on the subject of the boxing itself, the culminating fight between Adonis and Viktor is beyond ridiculous, even for this franchise. The boxing in Rocky films has never been even remotely realistic, with a laughable number of haymakers landing cleanly in every round of every fight, but Creed II takes this almost to the point of parody. In the recent Deontay Wilder vs. Tyson Fury fight, the total power punches landed was 31-38 from 182-104 thrown (17%-36.5%), whilst overall punches was 71-84 from 430-327 (16.5%-25.7%). These numbers are a little below the heavyweight average (which is 15 punches per round), but they\'re not especially unusual. In one round towards the end of Creed II, I counted Creed landing 19 power punches to Drago\'s 12. That\'s just ridiculous, to the point where it completely takes you out of the film. There\'s also an unintentionally hilarious moment when Adonis is knocked down, and Little Duke, apparently auditioning as the worst corner man in boxing history, looks out to Bianca in the crowd and shrugs!\nInsanely, even ""Gonna Fly Now"", that most fundamental aspect of all Rocky movies (except the one it wasn\'t used in) is underwhelming; whereas the first film used it to carry the audience to the emotional highpoint, combining Ludwig Göransson\'s interpolation of Bill Conti\'s legendary score with the on-screen action and Rocky screaming, ""You\'re a Creed"" as a way to inspire Adonis off the canvas, Creed II just kind of randomly drops it into the mix without a whole lot of justification or thematic relevance.\nAlthough there are some laudable elements here, Creed II is a disappointment in almost every way, from the dull and soulless domestic scenes to a dénouement that goes beyond suspension-of-disbelief, with not a hint of unpredictability. By essentially deconstructing the Rocky template, Creed found its way to unexpected thematic depths, recasting the great-white-hope subtext into a narrative about a struggling black man, whilst also examining notions of masculinity in the 21st century, and having Rocky himself face his own mortality. Creed II exists entirely on the surface. Sure, the Rocky melodrama is there, the Rocky fights are there, the Stallone one-liners are there, but with a narrative focused almost entirely on the less interesting characters, this has to go down as a missed opportunity. Apart from the Drago subplot, everything is by-the-numbers. Yes, we care about these characters, but that\'s primarily because of the previous films, and whereas Creed forged a path very much its own, Creed II returns us to the safety of the overly familiar.'], ['10%', ""I finally got around to this, and I think my issue with it is Adonis Creed.\nI kind of passed it over in the first one, because, honestly, it was just nice to see another Rocky movie, and you did see Creed train and fight and struggle a bit.\nWhat we have is a kid that grew up an orphan, but at a young age got adopted into a life of privilege, had a good job, and didn't have to struggle financially, until he kind of did when he wanted to become a full time boxer... and then the story takes off.\nAnd that was all passable, because he didn't exactly win did he? It was a hard fought first movie and he still had to go through a pretty tough arch to get to where he was that was both interesting and compelling... so despite the relative flaws in Creed, it was an enjoyable enough film to watch and far better than most of the movies we've been getting lately.\nBy the time Creed II rolls around, however, Adonis Creed is just whiny. And that's really it, his character isn't really allowed to progress any further, he's not allowed to grow in any way.\nThe poster suggests that there was a hard fought and emotional battle that Adonis had to over come and made it through a better man that when he started. The raw emotion of the poster makes us believe that he faced something insurmountable and came out victorious through sheer will alone.\nAnd, honestly, that is how the fight itself played out and I loved every minute of it. Both Michael B. Jordan and Florian Munteanu sold each and every blow and you could almost feel it as you sat back shoving your face with popcorn.\nBut in the end, Adonis was still the same whiny little brat he was at the start of the first Creed installment and we are two films in. He hasn't grown in any way, no personal faults were over come. He's not at all a changed person, so you're left with the feeling that you haven't grown with him, you haven't progressed any, and by the end of the film you are left wondering what the point of it all was.""], ['90%', ""Creed II takes pieces of the previous Rocky stories and is able to completely transform them into a better, more emotional story that can easily resonate with audiences.\nIf I have one big complaint about this installment, it would be that the script steals almost every single story beat from Rocky IV. But, at the same time, that is one of the most interesting aspects. Rocky IV had so much potential to be an emotionally impactful movie but failed to capture that tone due to the 80s camp that was heavily featured. In Creed II, we get to see the fallout of the fight between Rocky and Drago. Where Rocky went on to be a national treasure in retirement, Drago met a worse fate in Russia. His wife left him, his country turned its back on him, and he and his son were completely alone. This isolation drives the two in order to regain the respect of their countrymen and is a very compelling motive. On the other hand, Adonis is attempting to gain redemption for the Creeds by beating the fighters that single handedly killed his father all those years ago. This story is able to evolve all of our main characters, with Donnie being able to accept his father's absence and become a father figure for his newly born daughter. Rocky learns to care for and communicate with others, resulting in him gaining a relationship with his son. And with the Drago’s realizing that they don’t need the acceptance of Russia to become successful in their own right. This story really worked for me and was exactly the type of film I wished Rocky IV would have been.\nOur cast is once again superb; Michael B. Jordan’s chemistry with Stallone and Tessa Thompson is fantastic, and he is so great in this role. There is a scene with Rocky giving Adonis a very emotional speech about why he wants to fight, and it honestly rivals his speech in Rocky Balboa; it sent shivers down my spine. Our villains are spectacular. Dolph Lundgren is incredible and actually has a substantial role, with him being the hard-nosed jackass of a father to Viktor. His journey towards the end of the movie is very fulfilling. Florian Munteanu was a surprise and was really able to portray the complex emotions of his character. His subtle facial expressions during the final fight really showed that his heart was not fully in it, unlike his father.\nThe fight scenes are fantastic. There is a sudden brutality to them that really emphasizes the sheer size and power of Viktor Drago, creating a very intimidating feel to the matches. Even though the choreography and cinematography might not be as great as the original, it is still able to do an incredible job of staging and filming the fights.\nOverall, this movie is genuinely excellent, and while it might not fully live up to the original, it is a worthy successor in almost every way.\nScore: 88%\nVerdict: Excellent""], ['60%', 'I like the 1st Creed alot.

This is exactly the type of indie filmmaking that we need more of, and the awkwardly charming Greta Gerwig has hit a home run with her equally awkwardly charming directorial debut.\nThe film gives an unromantic glimpse into middle class life in 2002, where we meet Lady Bird (Saoirse Ronan), her recently laid off and depressed dad (Tracy Letts), and her hardworking, steadfast mom (Laurie Metcalf). The film is perfectly cast, with Ronan and Metcalf being the real standouts (the two are at their best when pushed into blow-up clashes between mother and daughter, an emotional tug of war between a teen impatient to break away from a hometown that’s beneath her and a mother so desperately hanging on that she’s unable to express her love and disappointment). It’s apparent the actors felt emotionally connected to the material while on set, and their performances bring a biting honesty and empathy to the family dynamics of Gerwig’s screenplay.\nGerwig has said the film is semi-autobiographical and she writes with an authentic voice, taking great care with her story (a story told with the hindsight of being a grown up). She brings a confident wisdom, an earnest insight, and a fresh voice through a witty and bright script that mirrors her true-to-life, free spirited personality. It’s as if the film exists within its own glowing aura. With Gerwig at the helm, the film has a particular hipster quirkiness written all over it, yet its sunny disposition and sharp humor is abundant with sincerity and avoids falling into the trap of being overly cynical or jaded.\nThe film is so observant that I could totally and wholly relate to our adolescent heroine through a realism that instantly transported me to the past. While I grew up in a different decade, some of the situations seemed like actual pages ripped out of my own high school experience.

It\'s a tale of her emotional development, her boyfriends (Lucas Hedges and Timothée Chalamet) and of her journey to adulthood that is at times poignant, at times self-indulgent but unfortunately, for me anyway, pretty disengaging. Her character is selfish and thoughtless - although not unsophisticated. Like many a story of our adolescence, it is fascinating for those it effects but is little more than dreary hormonal stuff for observers.

However, the acting performances are terrific, especially from Damon, whom I never really had much time for up until this film.\nI was also impressed by the performance of Will's girlfriend, played by Minnie Driver.

We really know that guy is not a bad person, but it's not easy to like the character due to his options and his bad social attitude. However, what bothered me the most was the construction of Robin Williams' character and his whole way of acting and accompanying that patient. I think anyone who has ever had the need to see a psychiatrist knows that they have strict rules about what they can and cannot do, and Williams' character breaks a good number of them.\nAnd this leads us to talk about actors. I really enjoyed Williams' work, but he is a long way from the best that the actor has given us. Matt Damon also did a good job, perhaps one of the best of his career, and one that opened more doors for him in his professional life. Stellan Skarsgard also intelligently took advantage of the opportunity to impose himself on the American cinematic scene, with a job well done and of great merit. Minnie Driver also did an interesting job, perhaps even more so than Ben Affleck, whose character doesn't have as much visibility or relevance.\nTechnically, the film has many merits, starting with the excellent cinematography, a good set of sets and interesting costumes.

So much of this went way over my head when watching this as a kid. Condoms breaking, calling cars pussy wagons, singing about chicks creaming and swimsuits getting damp, I forgot how much double entendre and innuendo there is in the song lyrics and the movie as a whole.\nWhat’s even more interesting is the theory of how Sandy in fact died on the beach in the opening scene and that the rest of the film is the dying, oxygen starved fantasy of her brain. Think about it - in the song “Summer Nights” from Sandy’s point of view, Danny says that when he met Sandy, “I saved her life; she nearly drowned.” What if I told you that, in reality, she did drown hence why on the beach Sandy, as she enters the alternate plane asks him “Is this the end?” He replies, “Of course not. It’s only the beginning.” She then has the dying brain fantasy of a year of high school romance with Danny, the visions get more and more outlandish as the time passes, before, at the climax of the movie she and Danny drive off in a car that leaves the ground and drives off into heaven, in what we can only speculate are her final moments.\nAnyway that’s something to think about next time you watch it.

This narrative thread is run concurrently with the Voldermort movements, where he now has in his possession The Elder Wand (the wand to rule them all) and has gathered a vast army to descend upon Hogwarts and achieve his ultimate goal of killing Harry.

Being one of those who has never read the books I can't say what has been left out or if anything has been tampered with for dramatic licence? What I know for sure is that the emotional investment garnered from being with this story for so long, to be part of these characters lives, watching them grow, ensures that this closure piece pounds the senses. Sitting down to watch it you realise that we are going to lose people we care for, and Hogwarts, the wonderful place we fist glimpsed across the night time water, is going to be attacked and reduced to a battle scarred place of war.\nAs the effects work dazzles and the one time child actors come shining through as mature actors who have casted off previous wooden traits, the story filling strands show just what wonderful work Rowling achieved on the page. Some of the characters never stood a chance in life, some carried deep emotional scars, and others held secrets so crucial to the whole Potter universe. For a series of such fantastical genre sparkle, the Harry Potter world eventually reveals itself to be a deep and fortified humanist drama, and engaging it most certainly is. That this is achieved as battlefield carnage is raised, with wand wars booming up on the screen, it means credit is due to all involved in the making of such a cherished and intensely followed Octalogy.\nIs it the earth shattering finale one hoped for? Well not quite.

Harry the boy now burgeoning into a man versus the snake faced despot surely should have been a crowning glory, but sadly not so.

Following straight on from the frustratingly incomplete scene setter that was Deathly Hallows Part 1, we continue to track Harry, Hermione and Ron as they search for the remaining Horcruxes that will render the evil Lord Voldermort as a mere mortal. This narrative thread is run concurrently with the Voldermort movements, where he now has in his possession The Elder Wand (the wand to rule them all) and has gathered a vast army to descend upon Hogwarts and achieve his ultimate goal of killing Harry. Meanwhile vital character story arcs are filled in and secrets will out...\nDavid Yates directs and Steve Kloves adapts to the screen, both of whom were perfect choices given their considerable input to the series. Smartly the pic has been kept to a 2 hour and 10 minute run time, and thankfully it flows nicely and the pace never stalls. Being one of those who has never read the books I can't say what has been left out or if anything has been tampered with for dramatic licence? What I know for sure is that the emotional investment garnered from being with this story for so long, to be part of these characters lives, watching them grow, ensures that this closure piece pounds the senses. Sitting down to watch it you realise that we are going to lose people we care for, and Hogwarts, the wonderful place we fist glimpsed across the night time water, is going to be attacked and reduced to a battle scarred place of war.\nAs the effects work dazzles and the one time child actors come shining through as mature actors who have casted off previous wooden traits, the story filling strands show just what wonderful work Rowling achieved on the page. Some of the characters never stood a chance in life, some carried deep emotional scars, and others  held secrets so crucial to the whole Potter universe. For a series of such fantastical genre sparkle, the Harry Potter world eventually reveals itself to be a deep and fortified humanist drama, and engaging it most certainly is. That this is achieved as battlefield carnage is raised, with wand wars booming up on the screen, it means credit is due to all involved the making of such a cherished and intensely followed Octalogy.\nIs it the earth shattering finale one hoped for? Well not quite. Story wise for sure that is the case, but with the whole story driving towards the final battle between Harry and Voldermort, it's disappointing to find it's rather brief and in truth anti climatic. Harry the boy now burgeoning into a man versus the snake faced despot surely should have been a crowning glory, but sadly not so. To compound this irritating disappointment, we then get the epilogue that is bogged down by aging make-up design that is almost laughable.

In what is ultimately a chase/escape movie, one where the characters have to fight not only a number of challenges that come their way, but also their new found in-fighting capabilities, Deathly Hallows 1 wonderfully dangles the carrot for the final series entry to come. But the overriding thoughts you come away with from it is that firstly it\'s not really that much fun, and secondly that it shouldn\'t have been a stand alone movie. Too much of it plods where exposition and padding strains to get the film through its near two and half hour running time.

Of the three principal young adult actors, it\'s still Emma Watson leading the way on ability, but alongside her, Radcliffe and Grint have earned our love and respect over the years for having to carry the weight of such expectation that has come with these roles. Fact is, is that now, having grown up with them and their characters for over ten years, we surely can accept them for not being multi ranged child actors. They have had to embody one character each for a decade, the range as such is the naturalism of aging through childhood like they have.

It is difficult to follow at times, but it's a sacrifice that unfortunately has to be made when adapting a long novel into a feature-length film. Despite this film being the slowest of the series, it does a tremendous amount of leg work setting up the epic conclusion. From the introduction of the Horcruxes to the multiple scenes of Voldemort's past, the audience gets a ton of background information revealing details from the previous film that creates a more coherent story structure.\nHalf-Blood Prince has a more focused return to Hogwarts and the class aspect which I enjoyed. Jim Broadbent's Professor Horace was a great addition and his connection with Potter is so seamless, with some aid from the Half-Blood Prince's textbook. Not only does Harry have great chemistry with Professor Horace, but his relationship with Dumbledore blossoms, and his reverence for the headmaster is captivating. It was great to see these two finally working together and trusting each other. Previously Harry would always hold information or Dumbledore would tell Harry to never mind, but finally, they get on the same page, and it was great to see.\nThis connection aids tremendously in the final scenes of the film. The trials that these two characters are put through are immense, but Harry's trust in Dumbledore is shown in a very uncomfortable scene of Dumbledore forcing down a poison of some sort. This struggle crescendos into an incredibly impactful finale with Dumbledore, unfortunately, dying at the hands of Snape. There were some fantastic character moments between Snape and Malfoy, and the light inside both of them is hinted at in this final scene. Dumbledore's death is felt, not only by the students of Hogwarts but by the audience as well. This is one of the more effective deaths in the series due to the audience's time with the character, as opposed to the death of Sirius Black in the previous film.\nOverall, this movie is slow and can drag on a bit.
